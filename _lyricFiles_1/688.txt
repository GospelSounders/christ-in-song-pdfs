. God is our refuge and  defense, In trouble our unfailing aid; Secure in His omni potence,  What foe can make  our  souls afraid? What foe  can make our  souls afraid? 2. Yea, though the earth's foundations rock, And mountains down the gulf  be hurled, His people smile amid the shock;  They look beyond  this  transient world, They look  beyond this  transient world. 3. Built by the word of His  command, Ten thousand worlds on noth ing rest; All living things are in  His hand,  And He who trusts  His  word is blest, And He who trusts His  word is blest.
