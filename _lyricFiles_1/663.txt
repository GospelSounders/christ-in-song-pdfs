. Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!  E'en tho' it be a cross That raiseth me!  Still all my song shall be, Nearer, my God, to Thee, 2. Tho' like the wanderer, Daylight all gone,  Darkness be over me, My rest a stone;  Yet in my dreams I'd be Nearer, my God to Thee, 3. There let the way appear, Steps up to heav'n,  All that Thou sendest me, In  mercy giv'n;  Angels to beckon me Nearer, my God, to Thee, 4. Then, with my waking tho'ts Bright with Thy praise,  Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise;  So by my woes to be Nearer, my God, to Thee, 5. Or if, on joyful wing Cleaving the sky,  Sun, moon, and stars forgot, Up ward I fly,  Still all my song shall be, Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee.
