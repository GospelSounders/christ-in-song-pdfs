. I have a Saviour, He's pleading in glory, A dear, loving Saviour, tho' earthfriends be few; And now  He is watching in ten derness o'er me, And O  that my Savswered— iour were your Saviour too! 2. I have a Father: to me  He has given A hope for eternity, blessed and true; And soon  will He call me to meet Him in heaven, But O  that I might  hear Him welcome you too! 3. A robe fair and spotless, resplen dent in whiteness, Is waiting in glory my wondering view; And when  I receive it all shin ing in brightness, Dear friend,  I would see  you receiving one too! 4. To me has been given a peace  like a river— A peace that the friends of this world never knew; And Christ  is the Author, and Christ  is the Giver, And O  that His peace  might be given to you! 5. When Jesus has found you, tell oth ers the story, That my loving Saviour is your Saviour too; Then pray  that your Saviour may bring  them to glory, And prayer  will be an  'twas answered for you! Your Saviour, too, Your Saviour, too; My Saviour bids me tell you, He's your Saviour, too.
