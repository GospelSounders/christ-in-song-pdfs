. When Thou comest in Thy kingdom, Jesus, Lord, remember me, Thus the penitent thief entreat ed Christ, the Lord, on Calvary. 2. When Thou com est in Thy king dom, Sinful tho' my heart may be, Like the penitent thief I pray  Thee, Jesus, Lord, remember me. 3. When Thou com est in Thy king dom, Mounting upward to the skies, Like the penitent thief, I pray  to Be with Thee in Paradise. Never in vain,  never in vain, Faith inspire  this wonderful strain. When Thou comest in Thy kingdom, Jesus, Lord, remember me.
