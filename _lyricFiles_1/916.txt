. Hark! hark, my soul! Angelic songs are swelling O'er earth's green fields, and ocean's wavebeat shore; How sweet the truth those blessed strains are telling Of that new life when sin shall be no more. 2. Onward we go, for still we hear them sing ing, "Come, weary souls, for Jesus bids you come;" And through the dark, its echoes sweetly ring ing, The music of the gospel leads us home. 3. Far, far away, like bells at evening peal ing, The voice of Jesus sounds o'er land and sea, And laden souls, by thousands meekly steal ing, Kind Shepherd, turn their weary steps to Thee. 4. Rest comes at length: though life be long and drea ry, The day must dawn, and darksome night be past; Faith's journeys end in welcome to the wea ry, And heav'n, the heart's true home, will come at last. 5. Angels, sing on! your faithful watches keep ing; Sing us sweet fragments of the songs above; Till morning's joy shall end the night of weep ing, And life's long shadows break in cloudless love. Angels of Jesus, Angels of light, Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night.
