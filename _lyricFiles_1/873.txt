. Breaking thro' the clouds that gather O'er the Christian's natal skies, Distant beams, like floods of glory, Fill the soul with glad surprise; And we almost hear the echo Of the pure and holy throng, In the bright, the bright forever, In the summerland of song. 2. Yet a little while we lin ger, Ere we reach our journey's end; Yet a little while of la bor, Ere the ev'ning shades descend; Then we'll lay us down to slumber, But the night will soon be o'er; In the bright, the bright forever, We shall wake, to weep no more. 3. O the bliss of life eter nal! O the long unbroken rest! In the golden fields of pleas ure, In the region of the blest; But, to see our dear Redeemer, And before His throne to fall, There to bear His gracious welcome,— Will be sweeter far than all. On the banks beyond the river We shall meet, no more to sever; In the bright, the bright forever, In the summerland of song.
