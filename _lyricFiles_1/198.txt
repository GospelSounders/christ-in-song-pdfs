. There's  sunshine in my soul today, More  glorious and bright Than  glows in any earthly sky, For Jesus is my light. 2. There's  music in my soul today, A  carol to my King, And,  Jesus listening, can hear The songs I cannot sing. 3. There's  springtime in my soul today, For  when the Lord is near, The  dove of peace sings in my heart, The flow'rs of grace appear. 4. There's  gladness in my soul today, And  hope, and praise, and love, For  blessings which He gives me now, For joys laid up above. O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine, When the peaceful, happy moments roll; When  sun shinein the soul,   peaceful, happy moments hap py mo-mentsroll,  Jesus shows His smiling  face There is sunshine in the soul.
