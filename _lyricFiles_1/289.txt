. Jesus, keep me near the cross, There a precious fountain Free to all, a healing stream,  Flows from Calv'ry's mountain. 2. Near the cross, a trembling soul, Love and mercy found me; There the bright and Morning Star  Sheds its beams around me. 3. Near the cross! O Lamb of God, Bring its scenes before me; Help me walk from day to day,  With its shadows o'er me. 4. Near the cross I'll watch and wait, Hoping, trusting ever; Till I reach the golden strand,  Just beyond the river. In the cross, in the cross, Be my glory ever; Till my raptur'd soul shall find Rest beyond the river.
