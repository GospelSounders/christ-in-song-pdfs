. "We would see Jesus;" for the shadows lengthen Across the little landscape of our life; We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen For the last conflict, in this mortal strife. 2. "We would see Jesus;" Rock of our salvation, Whereon our feet were set with sov'reign grace; Not life, nor death,  with all their agita tion, Can thence remove us, gazing on His face. 3. "We would see Jesus;" other lights are paling, Which for long years we did rejoice to see; The blessings of  this sinful world are fail ing; We would not mourn them, in exchange for Thee. 4. "We would see Jesus;" this is all we're needing,— Strength, joy, and willingness come with the sight; We would see Je sus, dying, risen, plead ing, Soon to return and end this mortal night!
