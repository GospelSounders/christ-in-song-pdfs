"My times  are in Thy hand;" Why should  I doubt or fear? My Father's hand will never cause His child a needless tear.  My Father's hand will never cause His child a needless  tear.  3. "My times  are in Thy hand;" I'll al ways trust in Thee, Till I possess the promised land, And all Thy glory see.  Till I possess the promised land, And all Thy glory  see.
