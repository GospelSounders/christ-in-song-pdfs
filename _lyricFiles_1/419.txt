. Jesus, these eyes have ne ver seen That radiant form of Thine; I  of sense hangs dark between Thy blessed face and mine. 2. I see Thee not, I hear  Thee not, Yet art Thou oft with me;   has ne'er so dear a spot, As where I meet with Thee. 3. Like some bright dream that comes  unsought, When slumbers o'er me roll,   age ever fills my tho't, And charms my ravished soul. 4. Yet tho' I have not seen, and still Must rest in faith  lone,   Thee, dearest Lord, and will, Unseen, but not unknown.
