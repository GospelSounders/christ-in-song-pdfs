. Christian, the morn breaks   sweetly  o'er  thee, And all the midnight shadows  flee; Ting'd are the dis tant  skies  with  glory, A beacon light hangs  out for thee. Arise! arise! the light  breaks  o'er thee, Thy name is graven on the throne; Thy home is in that world of glory Where thy Redeemer  reigns alone. 2. Toss'd on the rude,  relentless  surg es, Calmly compos'd  and dauntless,  staud; For lo, beyond  these  scenes  emerg es The hights that bound  the  promis'd land. Behold! behold! the land  is  near ing, Where storms of evil rage no more; Hark, how the heav'nly hosts are cheer ing! See in what throngs  they  range the shore. 3. Cheer up, cheer up, the  day breaks o'er  thee, Bright as the sum mer's noontide  ray; The starry crowns  and  realms of glo ry Invite thy hap py  soul away. Away! away! leave all  for glo ry, Thy name is graven on the throne, Thy home is in that world of beau ty Where thy Redeem er  reigns alone.
