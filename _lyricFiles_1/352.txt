.Conq'ring kings  their titles take From  the foes  they captive make; Je sus, by  a no bler deed, From rythe thou sands He hath freed. Yes; none other Name is giv'n Unto mortals under heav'n, Which can make the dead arise, And  exalt  them to the skies. 2.That  which Christ  so hard ly wrought, That  which He  so dearly bought, That  salva tion, mor tals may Spurn  and mad ly cast away; Rather gladly for that Name Bear the cross, endure the shame; Joyfully for Him to die Is not death,  but victory. 3.Je sus, Who  dost con descend To  be called  the sinner's Friend, Hear us as  to Thee  we pray, Glo ing in  Thy Name today. Glory to the Father be, Glory, holy Son, to Thee, Glory to the Ho ly Ghost, From  the saints  and angelhost. Amen.
