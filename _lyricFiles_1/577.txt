. Beautiful the little hands That fulfill  the Lord's commands; Beautiful the little eyes, Kindled with light from the skies. 2. All the little hands were made Jesus' pre cious cause to aid; All the little hearts to beat Warm in His service so sweet. 3. All the little lips should pray To the Sav iour ev'ry day; All the little feet should go Swift on His errands below. 4. What your little hands can do, That the Lord  intends for you; Make that thing your first delight, Do it for Him with your might. Beautiful, beautiful, are the hands That fulfill  the Lord's commands; Beautiful, beautiful, are the eyes, Kindled with light from the skies.
