. Pass me not, O gentle Saviour, Hear my humble cry, While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by. 2. Let me at the throne of mercy Find a sweet relief; Kneeling there in deep contrition, Help my unbelief. 3. Trusting only in Thy merit, Would I seek Thy face; Heal my wounded, broken spirit, Save me by Thy grace? 4. Thou the Spring of all my comfort, More than life to me; Whom have I on earth beside Thee! Whom in heav'n but Thee? Saviour, Saviour, hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by.
