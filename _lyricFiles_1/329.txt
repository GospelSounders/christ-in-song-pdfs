. The spacious firmaments lence,on  high,  With  all  the  blue,  ethereal  sky, And spangled heav'ns, a shin ing  frame,  Their  great  Origdiant inal  proclaim: Th'unwearied sun from day to day Does his Creator's pow'r display, And publishes to ev'ry land The work   of an   almighty hand. 2. Soon as the eve'ning shades  prevail,  The  moon  takes  up the won drous  tale; And nightly, to the list 'ning  earth  Repeats  the  story of her  birth; While all the stars that round her burn, And all the plan  ets in their turn, Confirm the tidings as they roll, And spread   the truth from pole to pole. 3. What tho' in solemn shades  preall  Move  round  the  dark  terres trial  ball? What tho' no real  voice  nor  sound Amid  their  raorbs  be  found? In reason's ear they all rejoice, And ut  ter forth   a glo  rious voice, Forever singing as they shine, "The hand   that made   us is divine."
