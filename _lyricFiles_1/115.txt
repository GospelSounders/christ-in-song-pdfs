. The gospel trump is sounding The year of jubilee, And grace is all abounding, To set the bondmen free. Forsake your wretched service, Your Master's claims are o'er; Avail yourselves of freedom, Be Satan's slaves no more. 2. A better Masters's calling, In accents true and kind; He asks a loving ser vice, And claims a willing mind. He offers you salvation, And points to joys above; And, longing, waits to make  you The objects of His love. 3. In living faith accept Him, Give up all else beside; While grace is loudly call ing, Look to the Crucified. Return, return ye captives, Return unto your home, The gospel trump is sound ing, The jubilee is come.
