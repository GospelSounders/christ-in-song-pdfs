. Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus! " Kept, by the pow'r of God;  Kept, from the world unspotted, Treading where Jesus trod.  2. Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus! " Serving as He shall choose;  "Kept" for the Master's pleasure; "Kept" for the Master's use.  3. Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus! " Kept from the world apart;  Lowly in mind and spirit, Gentle and pure in heart.  4. Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus! " Oh, to be all His own!  Kept, to be His forever, Kept to be His alone!  Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus! " Lord at Thy feet  I fall;  I would be "nothing, nothing, nothing;" Thou shalt be "all  in all."
