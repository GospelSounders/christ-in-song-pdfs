. What a fellowship, what a joy divine, Leaning on the everlasting arms; What a blessedness, what a peace is mine, 2. O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way, Leaning on the everlasting arms; O how bright the path grows from day to day, 3. What have I to dread, what have I to fear, Leaning on the everlasting arms? I have blessed peace with my Lord so near, Leaning on the everlasting arms. Lean ingon Je sus,leaning, Safe and secure from all alarms; Leaning, leaning, Leaning on the everlasting arms.
