. Jesus bids us shine with a pure, clear  Like a little candle burning in the night; In this world of darkness we must shine, You in your corner, I in mine. 2. Jesus bids us shine thro' the gloom aMany kinds of darkness in this world are found; Sin, and want, and sorrow: so we shine, You in your corner, I in mine. 3. When we shine for others we shine for  Well He sees and knows it if our light is dim; He looks down from heaven, sees us shine, You in your corner, I in mine. 4. Jesus is a bright light of love diWhen on Him we're looking, then it is we shine, Like the silver moon, with borrowed light, Each in his corner, doing right.
