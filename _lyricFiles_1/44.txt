##THERE’S ROOM FOR YOU TO ANCHOR

###“In my Father’s house are many mansions;...I go to prepare a place for you” (John 14:2).
1. There's room for you to anchor Within the port of rest,  
Where tempests all are over, And calms no more molest;  
How sweet to weary voyagers This precious promise giv'n:  
There's room for you to anchor Safe in heav'n!  

2. There's room  for you  to anchor; The ship  is waiting now,—  
The ship  of God's preparing, O ask not why nor how.  
His boundless love and mercy No tongue can ever tell,
If you but trust His promise, All is well.  

3. The same  dear friends  shall meet us That we  have loved below;  
The same  sweet voices greet us As in the long ago.  
Then hush! ye murm'ring waters, Ye tempests, cease to blow!  
I almost hear the music Soft and low.  

4. O heaving, swelling billows, Bear on ward to my home!  
Beyond  these dreary headlands I see its shining dome.  
There, there my fainting spirit No more for rest shall sigh;  
'Tis there I hope to anchor, By and by.  

REFRAIN.
There's room (for you), there's room (for you); 
There's room (for you), there's room (for you); 
There's room for you to anchor Safe in heav'n.
