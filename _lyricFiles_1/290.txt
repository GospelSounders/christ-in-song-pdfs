. Since on my Saviour I believed, His beams around me shine; The Spirit's witness I received, I know that He is mine. 2. I know His love, His faithful care; His mighty saving pow'r; His willingness to answer pray'r, His grace in sun and show'r. 3. In His dear wounded hands I leave All that concerneth me; The flow'rs that please, the thorns that grieve, Shall fraught with blessing be. 4. Tho' all things else should pass away, He changeless would remain. So will I sing, till dawns His day, Faith's jubilant refrain. "I know  whom I have believed, and am  persuaded that He  is able To keep  what I have committed unto Him against that day."
