. All hail the power of  Jesus' name, Let  angels prostrate fall;  Let an gels prostrate fall; Bring  forth the royal  diadem,  } And 2. Ye chosen seed   of  Is rael's race, Ye  ransomed from the fall,  Ye ran somed from the fall, Hail  Him who saves  you  by His grace,    3. Let ev'ry kin  dred,  ev 'ry tribe, On  this terrestrial ball,  On this  terrestrial ball, To  Him all maj esty  ascribe.    4. O that which yon  der  sa cred throng, We  at His feet may fall;  We at His feet may fall, We'll  join the everlasting song,    crown Him,    crown Him,    crown Him,    crown Him, And  crown  Him Lord of all,  crown Him, And crown Him,    crown   Him, And crown   Him Lord of all.
