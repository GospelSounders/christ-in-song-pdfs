. God is  love; His mercy brightens All the path in  which we rove; Bliss He wakes, and  woe He streamlightens: God is wisdom,  God is love. 2. Chance and change  are busy ever; Man decays  and  ages move; But His  mercy  waneth never: God is wis dom,  God is love. 3. E'en the  hour that darkest seemeth Will His change less  goodness prove; From the gloom  His  brightness   eth: God is wis dom,  God is love. 4. He with  earthly care entwineth Hope and com fort  from above; Every where  His  glory shineth: God is wis dom,  God is love.
