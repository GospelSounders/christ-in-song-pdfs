. Meek and lowly, pure and holy, Chief among  the blessed three. Turning sadness into gladness, Heav'nborn art thou, charity! Pity dwelleth in thy bosom. Kindness reigneth o'er thy heart; Gentle thoughts alone can sway thee— Judgment hath in thee no part. 2. Hoping ever, failing never, Though deceived,  believing still; Long abiding, all confiding To thy heav'n ly Father's will; Never weary of welldoing. Never fearful of the end; Claiming all mankind as brothers, Thou dost all alike befriend.
