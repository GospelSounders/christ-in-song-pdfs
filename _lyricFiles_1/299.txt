. My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine, For Thee all the fol lies of sin I resign; My gracious Redeemer, my Sav iour art Thou;  2.I  love Thee, because  Thou hast first loved me, And purchased my par don on Calvary's tree; I love Thee for wear ing the thorns  on Thy brow;  3. I'll love Thee in life,  and I'll love Thee in death; I'll praise Thee as long  as Thou lendest me breath, And say when the death dew lies cold  on my brow,  4. In mansions of glo ry and endless delight, I'll ever adore  Thee in heaven so bright, And sing with the glit tering crown  on my brow,  If ever I loved  Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
