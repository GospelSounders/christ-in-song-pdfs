. Soon shall we meet again, Meet  ne'er to sever, Soon shall peace wreath her chain Round us forever; Our hearts can ne'er repose, Safe from each blast that blows, In this dark vale of woes;  Never— no, never! 2. Soon shall love freely flow Pure  as life's river; Soon shall sweet friendship glow, Change less forever; Where joys celestial thrill, There bliss each heart shall fill, And fears of parting chill  Never— no, never! 3. Then to that world of light Take  us, dear Saviour; May we all there unite, Bless ed forever; Where kindred spirits dwell, There may our music swell, And time our joys dispell  Never— no, never!
