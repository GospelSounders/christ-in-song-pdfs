. Angel voic es, ever singing Round Thy throne of light,  Angel harps,  forever ringing, Rest not day or night,  Thousands only live to bless Thee, And confess Thee Lord of might. Amen. 2. Thou who art  beyond the farthest Mortal eye can scan,  Can it be that Thou regardest Songs of sin ful man?  Can we feel that Thou art near us, And wilt hear us? Yes,  we can. Amen. 3. Yes, we know Thy love rejoicees O'er each work of Thine;  Thou didst ears  and hands and voices For Thy praise  combine;  Craftsman's art and music's measure For Thy pleasure Didst  design. Amen. 4. Here, great God,  today we offer Of Thine own to Thee;  And for Thine  acceptance proffer, All unworthily,  Hearts and minds, and hands and voices, In our choicest Melody. Amen.
