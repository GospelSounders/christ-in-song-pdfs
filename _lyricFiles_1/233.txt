. Jesus comes with pow'r to gladden, When love shines in,  Ev'ry life that woe can sadden, When love shines in;  Love will teach us how to pray, Love will drive  the gloom away, Turn our darkness in to day, When love shines in.  2. How the world will glow with beauty, When love shines in!  And the heart rejoice in duty, When love shines in;  Trials may  be sanctified, And the soul  in peace abide; Life will all be glo rified, When love shines in.  3. Darkest sorrows will grow brighter When love shines in,  And the heaviest burden, lighter, When love shines in.  'Tis the glo ry that will throw Light to show  us where to go; O the heart shall blessing know When love shines in!  4. We may have unfading splendor, When love shines in,  And a friendship true and tender, When love shines in;  When earthvic t'ries shall be won, And our life  in heav'n begun, There will be no need  of sun, For love shines in.  When love shines in,  When love shines  in,  How the heart  is turned to singing, When love  shines  in!  When love shines in,  When love shines  in,  Joy and peace to others bringing, When love shines in
