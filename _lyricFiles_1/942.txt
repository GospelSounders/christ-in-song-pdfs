.He  hath pass'd death's chill ing billow, And gone to rest;  Je sus smooth'd ( ) dying pillow,— O  slum ber blest!  2. When  the morn of glo ry breaking, Shall light  the tomb,  Beau tiful will be thy waking In fade less bloom;  3. Where  no wintry winds  are blowing,— No bur ial train,—  Crown'd with life's celestial glowing, We'll meet  again.
