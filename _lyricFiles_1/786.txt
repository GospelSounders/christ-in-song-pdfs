. Blest are  the pure  in heart, For they  our God shall see, And from  His pres ence ne'er depart Thro' all eter nity. 2. I will  be their  delight Who here  delight  in Me, And they  shall walk  with Me in white Who seek for purity. 3. No more  in thought they err, They're free from ev 'ry stain; They've wash'd  their robes  of char acter, And spot less they remain.
