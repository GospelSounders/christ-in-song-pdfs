. Jesus, my all,  to  heav'n has gone, He  whom I fix my hopes upon; His  track I see,  and I'll pursue  The  narrow way   till Him I view. 2. This is the way  I  long have sought, And  mourned because   I found it not; My  grief a bur den long has been,  Because I was   not saved from sin. 3. Now will I tell  to  all around, What  a dear Sav  iour I have found; I'll  point to Thy  redeeming blood, And  say, "Behold,   the way to God." I'll  praise  Him, I'll  praise  Him, Yes,  I'll  praise   my Lord and King.
