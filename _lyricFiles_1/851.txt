. Above the clouds  that veil the blue,  Beyond the stars  that glimmer through,  There is a home  unknown to care,—  Its gates ajar  invite me 2. The stream of life  with ceaseless flow, The holy joy  that angels know,  The golden harp,  the song divine,  The spotless robe— Faith calls them 3. The flow'rs that sleep  neath winter's snow,  The loved ones lost  to us below,  The voices hush'd  that used to sing,—  We'll find them all  where Christ is mine.  O home of beauty, free from sorrow!   O everlasting glad tomorrow! Faith swings the pearly portal wide,     Love calls me to my Father's side (my Father's side).
