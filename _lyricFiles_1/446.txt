. In the cross of Christ  I glory, Tow'ring o'er the wrecks of time, All the light of sa diance cred  story, Gathers round its head sublime. 2. When the woes of life  o'ertake me, Hopes deceive and fears  annoy, Never shall the cross   forsake me; Lo! it glows with peace and joy. 3. When the sun of bliss is beaming Light and love upon my way, From the cross the rastreaming, Adds new luster to the day. 4. Bane and blessing, pain  and pleasure, By the cross are sanc tified; Peace is there, that knows no  measure, Joys that through all time abide.
