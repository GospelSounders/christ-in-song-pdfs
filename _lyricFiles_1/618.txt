. Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me; Bless Thy little lamb tonight; Thro' the darkness be Thou near me, Keep me safe till morning light. 2. All this day Thy hand has led  me, And I thank Thee for Thy care; Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed  me, Listen to my evening pray'r. 3. May my sins be all forgiv en, Bless the friends I love so well; Take us all at last to heav en, Happy there with Thee to dwell.
