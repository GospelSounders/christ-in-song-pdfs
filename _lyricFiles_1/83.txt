. By  faith I view my Sav iour dying On the tree,  on the tree;  To  ev'ry sinner He  is crying, Look to Me,  look to Me.  He bids the guilty now draw near.  Repent, believe, dismiss their fear;  Hark,  hark! what precious words I hear:  Mercy's free,  mercy's free.  2. Jesus, the Lord of life,  hath spoken Peace  to me,  peace to me;  Now  all my chains of sin  are broken, I  am free,  I am free.  Soon as I on His name believed, His pard'ning grace my soul received,  And  was from sin and death  retrieved: Mer cy's free, mercy's free.  3. This  precious truth, ye sin ners hear it, Mer cy's free,  mercy's free;  Ye  ministers of God,  declare it, Mer cy's free,  mercy's free.  Visit the heathen's dark abode,  Proclaim to all the love of God,  And  spread the glorious news abroad, Mer cy's free, mercy's free.  4. Long  as I live I'll still  be crying, Mer cy's free, mercy's free;  And  thus shall be my theme when dying, Mer cy's free, mercy's free. And when the vale of death I've passed, When lodged above the stormy blast,  I'll  sing while endless ages last, Mer cy's free, mercy's free.
