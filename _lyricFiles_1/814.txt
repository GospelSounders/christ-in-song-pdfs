. 'Tis by the faith of joys to come We walk  thro' deserts dark  as night; WithTill  we  arrive at heav'n, our home, Truth is  our guide, and faith our light. 2. The want  of sight she well  supplies; She makes  the pear ly gates  appear; Far into distant worlds  she pries, And brings  eternal glories near. 3. Tho' li ons roar, and tempests blow, And rocks  and dan gers fill the way, Far joy  we tread the des ert thro', While faith inspires a heav'nly ray.
