. The day is  past and  gone, The evening shades  appear; O, may  we all  remember well The night of  death draws  near. 2. Lord, keep us  safe this  night, Secure from all our fears; May an gels guard us while  we sleep, Till morning  light appears. 3. When all our  days are  past, And we from time  remove, O, may  we in  Thy bos om rest— The bosom  of Thy  love.
