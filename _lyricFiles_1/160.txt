. O,  for a closer walk with God! A  calm and heav'nly frame,  A light to shine upon the road  That leads me to the Lamb.  2. Return, O holy Dove! return,— Sweet  Messenger of rest;  I hate the sins that made Thee mourn,  And drove Thee from my breast.  3. What  peaceful hours I once enjoyed! How  sweet their mem'ry still!  But they have left an aching void  The world can never fill.  4. The  dearest idol I have known, Whate'er that idol be,  Help me to tear it from Thy throne,  And worship only Thee.
