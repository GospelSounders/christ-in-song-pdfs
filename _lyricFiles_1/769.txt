. The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll  not want; He makes  me down  to lie  In pastures green; He lead eth me The qui et waters by. 2. My soul He doth restore  again; And me  to walk  doth make  Within the paths of right eousness, Ev'n for  His own  name's sake. 3. Yea, tho' I walk in death's dark vale, Yet will  I fear  no ill; For Thou art with me; and Thy rod And staff  do com fort still.
