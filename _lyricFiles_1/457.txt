. O Thou to whom, in ancient time, The psalm ist's  sacred harp was strung, Whom kings adored in songs sublime, And prophets  praised   with glowing tongue, 2. From ev'ry place below the skies, The grate ful  song,   the fervent prayer— The incense of the heart— may rise To heav'n,  and  find   acceptance there. 3. To Thee shall age, with snowy hair, And strength,  and  beau  ty, bend the knee, And childhood lisp with rev'rent air Its prais es  and its prayers to Thee.
