  I            weighs His grace;  The storm  I fear I  round me,  I   I            crown for me;  The cup  I drink   bitter     I            paths of woe;  The toil   work   lighter,     I            in His sight;  My all   blood   bringing,  a     face. The cross is not greater than His grace, The storm cannot hide His blessed face; I am satisfied to know That with Jesus here below, I can conquer ev'ry foe.
