. They  bro't their gifts  to Jesus, And laid them at  His feet,  And  love for this  dear Saviour, Made ev'ry off'ring sweet;  Good deeds and words of kindness, Help for the poor  of earth,  And  not a gift  among them Was tho't of little worth.  2. Apart from oth er givers A poor wayfar er stood;  He  saw the gifts  they offered, The poorest count ed good,  And he was filled  with longing, A gift, tho' poor,  to bring;  Alas! all empty handed He stood before the King.  3. "Dear  Lord," he cried  in sorrow, "I know how kind  Thou art,  Take  all I have  to give Thee, My sinful way ward heart."  Then Jesus ans wered softly, "Count not the gift  as small, Tho'  all of them  are precious, Thine is the best of all.  Wouldst bring a gift  to Jesus, That He will count  most sweet?  Say, "Lord, my heart  I give Thee," And lay it at His feet.
