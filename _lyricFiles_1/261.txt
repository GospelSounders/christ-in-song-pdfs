. Crown Him with many crowns, The Lamb upon His throne; Hark! how the heav'nly anthem drowns  All music but its  own! Awake, my soul, and sing Of Him who died for thee; And hail Him  as thy matchless King Thro' all eternity. 2. Corwn Him the Lord of love! Behold His hands and side, Those wounds, yet visible a bove, In beauty glorified: No angel in the sky Can fully bear that sight, But downward  bends his wond'ring eye At mysteries so great. 3. Crown Him the Lord of peace! Whose hand a scepter sways From pole to pole, that wars may  cease, And all be pray'r and  praise: His reign shall know no end, And round His pierced feet Fair flow'rs of  paradise extend Their fragrance ever sweet. 4. Crown Him the Lord of years, The Potentate of time, Creator of the rolling spheres,  Ineffably sublime! All hail! Redeemer, hail! For Thou hast died for me; Thy praise shall never, never fail Throughout eternity.
