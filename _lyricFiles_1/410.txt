. Jesus, Thy love can we  forget, And never  bring to mind The grace that  paid  our   hopeless  debt, And  bade us  pardon   find? 2. Shall we Thy life of grief forget, Thy fasting  and Thy pray'r, Thy locks  with  moun tain   vapors  wet, To  save us  from despair? 3. Gethsemane can we forget— Thy struggling  agony When night  lay  dark  on   Olivet, And  none to  watch with   Thee? 4. Our sorrows and our sins were laid On Thee, alone on Thee; Thy pre cious  blood  our   ransom  paid— Thine  all the  glory   be!
