. Holy Spirit, light divine, Shine upon  this heart of  mine, Chase the shades of night away, Turn  my dark ness into day. 2. Holy Spir it, pow'r divine, Cleanse this guil ty heart of  mine; Long has sin,  without control, Held  domin ion o'er my soul. Holy Spir it, all divine, Dwell within  this heart of  mine, Cast down ev'ry idolthrone, Reign supreme,  and reign alone.
