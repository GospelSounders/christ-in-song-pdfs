. Stand up, and  bless the  Lord, Ye people of His choice; Stand up, and  bless the Lord your God, With heart, and soul, and voice. 2. Tho' high a bove all  praise, Above all blessing high, Who would not  fear His holy  name, And laud and mag nify? 3. O for the  living  flame From His own altar brought, To touch our  lips, our souls in spire, And wing to heav'n our thought! 4. God is our strength and  song, And His salvation ours; Then be His  love in Christ pro claimed With all our ran som'd pow'rs.
