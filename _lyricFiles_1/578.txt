. We should be like gardens, Bright and sweet with flow'rs,  Bless'd with heaven's sunshine, Cheer'd by gentle show'rs;  Violets are the kind words, Roses, deeds of love,  Fragrant pinks and pansies, Tho'ts of God above.  2. Not a frown of anger, Not a shade of care,  Not one look of sadness Do the blossoms wear;  They are always trusting, This is how they grow  Beautiful and fragrant, In a world of woe.  3. Selfish tho'ts and wishes, Unkind words and deeds,  Are like cruel brambles, Thistles, thorns, and weeds;  Kind tho'ts are the sweetest, Loving words the best,  Yielding hope and comfort, Joy, and peace, and rest.  4. Jesus has a garden, Fill'd with children sweet;  We would be among them, bowing at His feet,  Drinking in life's waters, Growing by His grace,  Like the flowers looking Up into His face.  Beautiful flow'rs, beaytiful flow'rs, Bright with morning dew; Beautiful flow'rs, beautiful flow'rs, We would be like you.
