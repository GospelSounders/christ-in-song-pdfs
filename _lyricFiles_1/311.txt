.Tell me the old, old story, Of unseen things to  bove,  Of Jesus and His  glory, Of Jesus  and His  love. Tell  me the story simply, As to a  little child, For I am weak  and  weary, And helpless  and defiled. 2.Tell me the story slowly, That I may take it  in,—  That wonderful  redemp tion, God's reme dy for  sin. Tell  me the story oft en, For I  forget so soon; The "early dew"  of  morn ing Has passed a way at  noon. 3.Tell me the same old story When you have cause   fear  That this world's empty  glo ry Is costing  me too  dear. Yes,  and when that world's glo ry Is dawning  on my soul, Tell me the old,  old  sto ry: Christ Jesus  makes thee  whole. Tell me the old, old story, Tell me the old, old story, Tell me the old, old story Of Jesus and  His love.
