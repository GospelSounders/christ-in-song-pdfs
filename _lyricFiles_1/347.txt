.Fresh from the throne of glory, Bright in its crystal gleam,  Bursts out the living Fountain, Swells on the living Stream. 2.Stream full of life and gladness, Spring of all health and peace,  No harps by thee hang silent, Nor happy voices cease. 3.River of God, I greet thee, Now not afar, but near;  My soul to thy still waters Hastes in its thirstings here. 4.Jesus, the healing Fountain, Fresh from the throne above,  Thou art the living water, Thou art the stream of love. Holy River, I would ever Draw my life from thee (from thee); Mighty River, I will never Cease to  sing of thee.
