. Dearest name in earth or heaven, Sweetest name my heart hath known, By the Father it was given To  His well beloved Son. 2. To my heart it brings a blessing, And  my lips take up the strain, And His wond'rous name confessing, Tell  its sweetness o'er again. 3. Oh, my soul would swell the chorus, Sing ing His redeeming love, And ascribe eternal praises To  the name all names above. 'Tis the holiest name, 'Tis the loliest name; From the Father's lips  to the earth it came. Bro't by angels of light, In the stillness of night, Was the dear, dear name of Jesus.
