. O Lord divine, of all that is, The sweetest and the best, Fain would I come and rest tonight Upon Thy tender breast: I pray Thee turn me not away; For, sinful though I be, Thou knowest ev'rything I need, And all my need of Thee. 2. And yet the spirit in my heart Says, Wherefore should I pray That Thou shouldst seek me with Thy love Since Thou doest seek alway? And dost not even wait until I urge my steps to Thee; But in the darkness of my life Art coming still to me. 3. Thou hearest ev'ry tho't I mean, And not the words I say,— The hidden thanks among the words, That only seem to pray. Still, still Thy love will beckon me, And still Thy strength will come In many ways to bear me up And bring me to my home.
