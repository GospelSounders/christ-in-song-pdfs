.Jesus, I my cross have taken, All to leave and follow Thee;  All things else I have forsak en, Thou henceforth  my  all shalt be: Perish ev'ry fond ambition, All I've sought or hoped or known; Yet how rich is my condition, God and heav'n  are  still my own. 2.Let the world despise and leave  me, They have left my Saviour, too;  Human hearts and looks deceive  me; Thou art faith ful,  Thou art true; And, while Thou dost smile upon  me, God of wisdom, love and might, Foes may hate, and friends may shun  me; Show Thy face,  and  all is bright. 3.Hast'ning on from grace to glo ry, Arm'd by faith and wing'd by pray'r;  Heav'n's eternal day's before  me, God's own hand  is  guiding there. Soon shall close my earthly mis sion, Swift shall pass these pilgrim days, Hope shall change to glad frui tion, Faith to sight,  and  prayer to praise.
