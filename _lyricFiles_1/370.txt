. Fling out the banner! let it float Skyward and seaward, high and wide; Our glory only in theit cross; Our only hope, the Crucified. 2. Fling out the banner! angels bend In anxious silence o'er the sign, And vainly seek to comprehend The wonder of the love Divine. 3. Fling out the banner! sinsick souls, That sink and perish in the strife, Shall touch in faith its radiant hem, And spring immortal into life. 4. Fling out the banner! wide and high, Seaward and skyward, let it shine: Nor skill, nor might, nor mer ours; We conquer only in that sign.
