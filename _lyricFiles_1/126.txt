. Jesus, let  Thy pitying  eye Call back a wand'ring sheep; False  to Thee,  like Peter,  I Would fain like Peter, weep. Speak the  reconcil ing word, And let  Thy  mercy melt me down; Turn,  and look  upon me,  Lord, And break my heart of stone. 2. Saviour, Prince,  enthroned above, Repentance to impart, Give  me, thro'  Thy dying  love, The humble, contrite heart; Give what  I have long  implor'd, A por tion  of Thy grief unknown; Turn,  and look upon me,  Lord, And break my heart of stone. 3. For Thine own compassion's  sake, The gracious wonder show; Cast  my sins  behind Thy  back, And wash me white as snow: If Thy  pity now is stirr'd, If now  I  do myself bemoan, Turn,  and look upon me,  Lord, And break my heart of stone. 4. Clothe me with Thy holiness, Thy meek humility; Put  on me Thy glorious  dress— Endue my soul with Thee: Let Thine  image be  restor'd, Thy name  and  nature let me prove; Fill  me with Thy fulness,  Lord, And perfect me in love.
