. The great Physician now is near, The sympathizing Jesus; He speaks, the drooping heart to cheer, O hear the voice of Jesus! 2. Your many sins are all forgiv'n, O hear the voice of Jesus; Go on your way in peace to heav'n, And wear a crown with Jesus. 3. All glory to the dying Lamb! I now believe in Jesus; I love the blessed Saviour's name, I love the name of Jesus. 4. His name dispels my guilt and fear; No other name but Jesus; O how my soul delights to hear The precious name of Jesus! 5. And when He comes to bring the crown,— The crown of life and glory; Then by His side we will sit down, And tell redemption's story. Sweetest note in seraph song, Sweetest name on mortal tongue, Sweetest carol ever sung,— Jesus, blessed Jesus!
