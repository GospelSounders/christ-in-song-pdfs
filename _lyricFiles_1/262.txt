. O could  I speak the match less  worth,  O could I sound the glories forth, Which  in my Saviour shine! I'd  soar and touch the heav'nly strings, And  vie with Gabriel while he sings In  notes almost divine, In notes almost divine. 2. I'd sing  the pre cious blood  He  spilt,  My ransom from the dreadful guilt Of  sin and wrath divine! I'd  sing His glorious righteousness, In  which all perfect heav'nly dress My  soul shall ever shine, My soul shall ever shine. 3. I'd sing  the char acter  He  bears,  And all the forms of love He wears, Exalted on His throne; In  loftiest songs of sweetest praise, I  would to everlasting days Make  all His glories known, Make all His glories known. 4. Well, the  delightful day  will  come,  When my dear Lord will take me home, And  I shall see His face; Then,  with my Saviour, Brother, Friend, A  blest eternity I'll spend, Triumphant in His grace, Triumphant in His grace.
