. Majestic sweetness sits enthron'd Upon the Saviour's brow;  His head with radiant light is crown'd, His  lips with grace o'erflow,  His lips with grace o'erflow.  2. No mortal can with Him compare, Among the sons of men;  Fairer is He than all the fair That  fill the heav'nly train,  That fill the heav'nly train.  3. He saw me plung'd in deep distress, He flew to my relief; For me He bore the shameful cross, And  carried all my grief,  And carried all my grief.  4. To Him I owe my life and breath, And all the joys I have;  He makes me triumph over death, He  saves me from the grave,  He saves me from the grave.  5. To heav'n, the place of His abode, He brings my weary feet;  Shows me the glories of my God, And  makes my joy complete,  And makes my joy complete.  6. Since from His bounty I receive Such proofs of love divine,  Had I a thousand hearts to give, Lord,  they should all be Thine,  Lord, they should all be Thine.
