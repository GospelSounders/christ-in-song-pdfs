. Dare to do right, dare to be true! You have a work that no other can do; Do it so bravely, so kindly, so well, Angels will hasten the story to tell; Angels will hasten the story to tell. 2. Dare to do right, dare to be true! Other men's failures can never save you; Stand by your conscience, your honor, your faith; Stand like a hero and battle till death; Stand like a hero and battle till death. 3. Dare to do right, dare to be true! God who created you cares for you too; Treasures the tears that His striving ones shed, Counts and protects ev'ry hair of your head; Counts and protects ev'ry hair of your head. 4. Dare to do right, dare to be true! Keep the great Judgment day always in view; Look at your work as you'll look at it then— Scann'd by Jehovah, and angels, and men; Scann'd by Jehovah, and angels, and men. 5. Dare to do right, dare to be true! Jesus, your Saviour, will carry you through; City, and mansion, and throne, all in sight, Can you not dare to be true and do right? Can you not dare to be true and do right? Dare to do right, Dare to be true, Dare! dare! dare to be true!
