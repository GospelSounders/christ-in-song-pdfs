.Hover o'er me, Holy Spirit, Bathe my trembling heart and brow; Fill me with Thy hallow'd presence, Come, O come and fill me now. 2.Thou canst fill me, gracious Spirit, Tho' I cannot tell Thee how; But I need Thee, greatly need Thee; Come, O come and fill me now. 3.I am weakness, full of weakness; At Thy sacred feet I bow; Blest, divine, eternal Spirit, Fill with love, and fill me now. 4.Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me; Bathe, O, bathe my heart and brow; Thou art comforting and saving, Thou art sweetly filling now. Fill me now, fill me now, Jesus, come and fill me now. Fill me with Thy hallow'd presence, Come, O come and fill me now.
