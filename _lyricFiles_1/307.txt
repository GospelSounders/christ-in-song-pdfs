. When softly falls the  twi  light hour, O'er moor and moun  tain, field   and flow'r, How sweet   to leave   a world   of care, And lift   to heav'n   the voice of pray'r! 2. In sol  emn mid  night's  si  lence deep, When Na  ture's voice   is hush'd   in sleep, Then heav  y hearts   with grief   oppress'd May find   in pray'r   the sweet  est rest. 3. And when   with red  'ning  blush   of morn The new  born day   begins   to dawn, Then up  ward to   the mercyseat Let pray'r   ascend   like in  cense sweet. 4. When mid  day's burn  ing  heat   we feel, When dai  ly cares our hearts   would steal, O, then   to heav'n   we look away, And find in pray'r   our sur  est stay.
