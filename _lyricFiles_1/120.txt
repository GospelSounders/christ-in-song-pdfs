. Go not, my soul, in search of Him, Thou wilt not find Him there,—  Not in the depths of shadow dim, Nor heights of upper air.  For not in faroff realms of space The Spirit hath  its throne;  In ev'ry heart it findeth place, And waiteth to be known.  2. Tho't answereth alone to tho't, And soul with soul hath kin;  The outward God he findeth not Who finds not God within.  And if the vision come to thee Reveal'd by in ward sign,  Earth will be full of Deity, And with His glory shine.  3. O gift of gifts! O grace of grace! That God should condescend  To make thy heart His dwellingplace And be thy daily Friend!  For not in faroff realms of space The Spirit hath  its throne;  In ev'ry heart it findeth place, And waiteth to be known.
