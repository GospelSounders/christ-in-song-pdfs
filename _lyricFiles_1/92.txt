. Weeping will not save me— Tho' my face were bathed in tears, That could not allay my fears, Could not wash the sins of years— 2. Working will not save me— Purest deeds that I can do, Holiest thoughts and feelings, too, Cannot form my soul anew— 3. Waiting will not save me— Helpless, guilty, lost I lie, In my ear is mercy's cry; If I wait I can but die— 4. Faith in Christ will save me— Let me trust Thy weeping Son, Trust the work that He has done; To His arms, Lord, help me run— Weeping will not save me. Jesus wept and died for me; Jesus suffered on the tree; Jesus waits to make me free: He alone can save me.
