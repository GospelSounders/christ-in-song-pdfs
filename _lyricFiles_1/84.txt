. The mistakes of my life  are many, The  sins of my heart  are more,  And I scarce can  see  for weeping, But I knock at the o pen door.  2. I am lowest of those  who love Him, I am weakest of those  who pray;  But I come as  He  has bidden, And  He will not say  me nay.  3. My mistakes His free grace  will cover, My  sins He will wash  away,  And the feet that  shrink  and falter, Shall  walk thro' the gates  of day.         sinful, It comes to me more  and more;  But since the dear Saviour has bid me come in, I'll enter the open door.
