. He reigns! the Lord, the Saviour reigns!   Sing to His name in lofty strains, Let all the saints in songs rejoice, And in His praise   exalt their voice. 2. Deep are His counsels, and unknown,   But grace and truth support His throne; Tho' gloomy clouds His way surround, Justice is their   eternal ground. 3. In robes of judgment, lo, He comes!   Shakes the wide earth, and cleaves the tombs; Before Him burns devouring fire, The mountains melt,   the seas retire.
