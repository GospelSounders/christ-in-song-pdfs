. O for a faith that will not shrink, Tho' press'd by many a   That will not tremble poverty or  woe, Of foe; That will not tremble on the brink Of will not tremble  on the brink poverty or woe; 2. That will not murmur nor complain Beneath the chast'ning rod,     But in the hour of grief  or   God. Will lean   upon its God. 3. A faith that shines more bright and clear When tempests rage withThen when in danger darkness feels no  doubt; In out; Then when in danger knows no fear, In when in danger  knows no fear, darkness  feels no doubt; 4. That bears, unmoved, the world's dread frown, Nor heeds its scornful smile;  That sin's wild ocean cannot   guile. Nor its   soft  arts beguile. 5. Lord, give me such a faith as this, And then, whate'er may come,     I'll taste, e'en here the hal lowed   home. Of an   eternal home.
