. The  great decisive day  is at hand, is at hand! The  great decisive day  is at hand; The  day when Christ will come, To call His chil dren home, And to seal the sinner's doom,—  is at hand, is at hand;— And to seal the sinner's doom,  is at hand. 2. Those who made His crown of thorns  will be there, will be there! Those who made His crown of thorns  will be there! Those who smote Him with the reed Upon His sa cred head, And  made His temples bleed,—  will be there, will be there;— And  made His temples bleed,  will be there. 3. Where  will the sinner hide  in that day, in that day? Where  will the sinner hide  in that day? It will be in vain to call, "Ye mountains on  us fall," For His hand will find out all  In that day, in that day; For His hand will find out all  in that day.
