. Some day the silver cord will break, And I no more as now shall sing; But, O, the joy when I shall wake Within the palace of the King! 2. Some day my earthly house will fall, I cannot tell how soon 'twill be, But this I know— my All in All Has now a place in heav'n for me. 3. Some day, when fades the golden sun Beneath the rosytinted west, My blessed Lord will say, "Well done! " And I shall enter into rest. 4. Some day; till then I'll watch and wait, My lamp all trimmed and burning bright, That when my Saviour ope's the gate, My soul to Him may take its flight. And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the story— Saved by grace; And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the story— Saved   by grace.
