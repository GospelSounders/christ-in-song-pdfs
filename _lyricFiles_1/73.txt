. Now just a word for Jesus; Your dearest Friend so true, Come, cheer our hearts and tell us What He has done for you. 2. Now just a word for Jesus; You feel your sins forgiv'n, And by His grace are striving To reach a home in heav'n. 3. Now just a word for Jesus; A cross it cannot be To say, "I love my Saviour Who gave His life for me.' 4. Now just a word for Jesus; Let not the time be lost; The heart's neglected duty Brings sorrow to its cost. 5. Now just a word for Jesus; And if your faith be dim, Arise in all your weakness, And leave the rest to Him. Now just a word for Jesus— 'Twill help us on our way;  One little word for Jesus, O speak, or sing, or pray.
