. If your hand's on the plow, hold  on, hold on; Tho' the soil may be sterile and hard, The plowshare will make the fallow ground break, And the plowman will have his reward; Earth's  bosom will sparkle with emerald green, And its grain will be golden king; The reapers will come, with  loud "Harvest Home," And the gleaners will joyfully sing. Hold on, hold on, my 2. If your heart's in the work, hold  on, hold on; Tho' the way should be gloomy and sad, A light will appear, the pathway be clear, And the heart of the worker be glad; Heav'n's  portals will open and music resound, And the mansions of bliss will ring With praise for the brave, who  labor to save, And the angels will joyfully sing. Hold on,    brother, hold on, Hold on till the prize is won; Hold on to the plow, And weary not now, For the work is almost done.
