. The Lord my pasture shall prepare, And feed me  with a  shepherd's care; His presence shall my wants supply, And guard me  with a  watchful eye; My noonday walks He shall attend, And all my midnight hours defend. 2. When in the sultry glebe I faint, Or on the  thirsty  mountain pant, To fertile vales and dewy meads My weary,  wand'ring  steps He leads Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow, Amid the verdant landscape flow. 3. Tho' in the paths of death I tread, With gloomy horrors  overspread, My steadfast heart shall fear no ill, For Thou, O Lord, art  with me still; Thy friendly staff shall give me aid, And guide me thro' the dreadful shade. Amen.
