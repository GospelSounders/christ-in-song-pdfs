. O Thou who art of all that is Beginning and the end, We follow Thee thro' unknown paths, Since all to Thee must tend: Thy judgments are a mighty deep, Beyond all fathom line; Our wisdom is the childlike heart; Our strength, to trust in Thine. 2. We bless Thee for the skies above, And for the earth beneath; For hopes that blossom here below, And wither not with death; But most we bless Thee for Thyself, O heavenly Light within, Whose dayspring in our hearts, dispels The darkness of our sin.
