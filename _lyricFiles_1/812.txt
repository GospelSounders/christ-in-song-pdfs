. Father, whate'er of  earth ly bliss Thy sov'reign will denies, Accepted at Thy  throne of grace, Let this petition  rise:— 2. Give me a calm and  thank ful heart, From ev'ry murmur  free; The blessings of Thy  grace  impart, And make me live to  Thee. 3. Let the sweet hope that  Thou  art mine My life and death attend; Thy presence thro' my  journey shine, And crown my journey's  end.
