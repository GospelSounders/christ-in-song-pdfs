. Be with us, Lord, as forth we go, Winning precious souls to Thee; And make our love and zeal to glow, 2. Help us to labor faithfully, Winning precious souls to Thee; And gather many sheaves for Thee, 3. We toil with feeble hands and weak, Winning precious souls to Thee; To us new faith and courage speak, 4. As we each day our work pursue, Winning precious souls to Thee; Our faith increase, our zeal renew, 5. We need Thy help, O gracious Lord! Winning precious souls to Thee; Go with us, and Thy aid afford, 6. As we go forth in trust and love, Winning precious souls to Thee; Send down Thy blessing from above, Winning precious souls to Thee.  Winning precious souls,  many precious souls, Jewels in Thy crown to be; Help us bring them in  from the ways of sin, Many precious souls to Thee.
