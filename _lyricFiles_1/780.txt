. Jesus, engrave it on  my heart, That Thou the one thing needful art: I could from all  things parted be,  But never, nev er, Lord,  from Thee. 2. Needful is Thy most pre cious blood, To reconcile my soul   to God; Needful is Thy  indulgent care,  Needful Thy all  prevail ing prayer. 3. Needful art Thou, my Guide,  my Stay, Thro' all life's dark and wea  ry way; Nor will at last less needful be To bring me home to heav'n  and Thee.
