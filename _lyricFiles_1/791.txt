. Am I a soldier of the  cross, A foll'wer  of the Lamb? And shall I fear to own His  cause, Or blush to speak His name? Or blush to speak His  name? 2. Must I be carried to the  skies On flow'ry  beds of ease, Whilst others fought to win the  prize, And sailed thro' bloody seas? And sailed thro' bloody  seas? 3. Are there no foes for me to  face? Must I not  stem the flood? Is this vile world a friend to  grace, To help me on to God? To help me on to  God? 4. Sure I must fight if I would  reign; Increase my  courage, Lord; I'll bear the toil, endure the  pain, Supported by Thy Word, Supported by Thy  Word.
