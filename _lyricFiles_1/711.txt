. Revive Thy work, O Lord, Thy mighty arm make bare; Speak with the voice that wakes the dead, and make Thy people hear. Speak with the voice that wakes the dead, and make Thy people  hear. 2. Revive Thy work, O Lord, disturb this sleep of death; Quicken the smould'ring embers now by Thine almighty breath. Quicken the smould'ring embers now by Thine almighty  breath. 3. Revive Thy work, O Lord, create soulthirst for Thee; And hung'ring for the Bread of Life, oh, may our spirits be. And hung'ring for the Bread of Life, oh, may our spirits  be. 4. Revive Thy work, O Lord, exalt Thy precious name; And by the Holy Ghost our love for Thee and Thine inflame. And by the Holy Ghost our love for Thee and Thine inflame.
