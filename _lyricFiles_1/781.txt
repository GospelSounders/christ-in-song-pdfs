. When pow'r divine, in mortal form, Hush'd with a word the raging storm, In  sooth ing ac cents  Jesus said,  "Lo, it is I; be not  afraid." 2. So when in silence nature sleeps, And lonely watch the mourner keeps, One  thought  shall ev 'ry  pang  remove,  Trust, feeble man, thy Maker's love. 3. And when the last dread hour shall come, While tremb'ling nature waits her doom, This  voice  shall wake  the  righteous dead—  "Lo, it is I; be not  afraid."
