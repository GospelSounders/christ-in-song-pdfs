. In some way or other the Lord will provide; It may not be my way, It may not be thy way, And yet in His own way, "the Lord will provide." 2. At some time or other the Lord will provide; It may not be my time, It may not be thy time, And yet, in His own time, "the Lord will provide." 3. Despond then no longer, the Lord will provide; And this be the token— No word He hath spoken Was ever yet broken, "the Lord will provide." 4. March on, then, right boldly; the sea shall divide; The path shall be glorious; With shoutings victorious We'll join in the chorus, "the Lord will provide."
