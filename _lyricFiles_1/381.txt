. Father, again in Jesus' name we  meet,  And bow in penitence beneath   Thy feet; A gain to Thee  our  grateful voices  raise, To sue for mercy, and to  sing   Thy praise. Amen. 2. O we would bless Thee for Thy cease less  care,  And all Thy love from day to day   declare! Is  not our life  with  hourly mercies  crowned? Does not Thine arm encircle  us   around? Amen. 3. Alas! unworthy of Thy bound less  love,  Too oft with careless feet from Thee we rove; But  now encour aged  by Thy voice, we  come, Returning sinners, to a  Father's home. Amen. 4. O by that name in which all full ness  dwells,  O by that love which ev'ry love   excells, O  by that blood  so  freely shed for  sin, Open blest Mercy's gate, and  take   us in. Amen.
