. Are you Christ's lightbearer? Of His joy a sharer? Is this dark world fairer For your cheering ray? Is your beacon lighted, Guiding souls benighted To the land of perfect day? 2. Is your heart warm, glowing, With His love o'erflowing, And His goodness showing More and more each day? Are you pressing onward With His faithful vanguard, In the safe and narrow way? 3. Keep your altars burning, Wait your Lord's returning, While your heart's deep yearning Draws Him ever near; With His radiance splendid Shall your light be blended When His glory shall appear. O brother! is your lamp trimm'd and burning? Is the world made brighter by its cheering ray? Are you waiting, yearning For your Lord's returning? Are you watching day by day?
