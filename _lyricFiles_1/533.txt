. Would you win a Saviour's blessing? Freely, freely give;  Would you see His work progressing? Freely, freely give;  Let you souls with love expand, Open wide a liberal hand; Would you follow God's command?  Freely, freely give.  2. With a cheerful heart and willing, Freely, freely give;  Like the dew its balm distilling, Freely, freely give;  Have you little? Give your mite; O how precious in His sight! He your off'ring will requite;  Freely, freely give.  3. Give to spread the grand Old Story, Freely, freely give;  Give to speed the light of glory, Freely, freely give;  Would you gain a rich reward In the harvest of the Lord? Then obedient to His word,  Freely, freely give.
