. More diligence give me; Swift flieth the day,  Each moment some lost one Is passing away;  How can I be idle, Christ knowing so well?  More diligence give me, Love's story to tell.  2. More tenderness give me For wandering sheep,  Like Jesus the Shepherd, To search and to weep  In byways and hed ges, O'er desert and sea;  More tenderness give  me For sinners like me.  3. More gratitude give me, More love for my Lord,  More gifts for the Giver Who spreadeth my board;  More mem'ries of mer cies, More praises in pray'r,  More gladness in la bor, More trust with my care.  4. More purity give me, More hatred of sin,  More hung'ring and thirsting For goodness within;  More watching and pray ing, From self to be free;  More fruits of the Spir it, More, Jesus, of Thee.
