. To God  be the glory, great things He hath done, So loved He the world that He gave us His Son, Who yielded His life an atonement for sin, And opened the Lifegate that all may go in. 2. O per fect redemption, the purchase of blood, To ev'ry believer the promise of God; The vil est offender who truly believes, That moment from Jesus a pardon receives. 3. Great things  He hath taught us, great things He hath done, And great our rejoicing thro' Jesus the Son, But pur er, and higher, and greater will be Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice; Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice; O come  to the Father, thro' Jesus the Son, And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.
