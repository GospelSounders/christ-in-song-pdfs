. Saviour! Thy dying love Thou  gavest me,  Nor should I aught withhold, Dear  Lord, from Thee; In love my soul would bow, My heart fulfill its vow, Some off'ring bring Thee now, Something for Thee. 2. At the blest mercyseat, Pleading for me,  My feeble faith looks up, Je sus to Thee; Help me the cross to bear, Thy wondrous love declare, Some song to raise, or pray'r, Some thing for Thee. 3. Give me a faithful heart, Like ness to Thee,  That each departing day Hence forth may see; Some work of love begun, Some deed of kindness done, Some wand'rer sought and won, Some thing for Thee. 4. All that I am and have, Thy  gifts so free,  In joy, in grief, thro' life, Dear  Lord, for Thee! And when Thy face I see, My ransom'd soul shall be, Thro' all eternity, Some thing for Thee.
