. Tossed upon life's raging billow, Sweet it is,  O Lord, to know Thou didst press a sailor's pillow, Thou canst feel  a sailor's woe; Never slumb'ring, never sleeping, Tho' the night be dark and drear, Thou the faithful watch art keeping; "All is well," Thy constant cheer. 2. Thus my heart the hope will cherish, While on Thee  I lift mine eye, Thou wilt save me e'er I perish, Thou wilt hear  the sailor's cry; And tho' mast and sail be riven, Soon life's voyage will be o'er: Safely moored in heav'n's wide haven, Storm and tempest vex no more.
