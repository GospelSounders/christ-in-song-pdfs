. Onward, Christian soldiers! Marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus Going on before. Christ the royal Master, Leads against the foe, Forward into battle,  See His banners go! 2. At the sign of tri umph Satan's host doth flee, On then Christian soldiers, On to victory! Hell's foundations quiv er At the shout of praise, Brothers lift your voic es,  Loud you're anthems raise. 3. Like a mighty arm y Moves the church of God; Brothers we are treading Where the saints have trod; We are not divid ed, All one body we, One in hope and doc trine,  One in charity. 4. Crowns and thrones have per ished, Kingdoms rise and waned, But the church of Jesus Constant has remained. Gates of hell can nev er 'Gainst that church prevail; We have Christ's own pro mise,  That can never fail. 5. Onward, then, ye peo ple! Join our happy throng, Blend with ours your voices In the triumphsong; Glory, praise, and hon or Unto Christ the King; This thro' countless a ges  Men and angels sing. Onward, Christian soldiers!  Marching as to  war, With the cross of Jesus Going on before.
