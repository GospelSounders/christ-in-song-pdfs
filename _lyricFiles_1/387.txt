. Welcome, delightful  morn, Thou  day of sacred  rest; I hail thy kind returns; Lord  make these moments  blest. From  the low train of  mor tal toys I soar to reach  immor tal  joys, I  soar to  reach immortal  joys. 2. Now may the King  descend, And  fill His throne of  grace; Thy scepter, Lord, extend, While  saints address Thy  face; Let  sinners feel Thy  quick'ning   word, And learn to know and  fear  the  Lord. And  learn   to  know and  fear the  Lord. 3. Descend, celestial  Dove, With  all Thy quick'ning  pow'rs; Disclose a Saviour's  love, And  bless these sacred  hours: Then  shall my soul new  life  ob tain, Nor Sabbathdays  be  passed  in  vain. Nor  Sab  bathdays be  passed in  vain.
