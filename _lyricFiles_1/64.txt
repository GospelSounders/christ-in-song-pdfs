. Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole; I want Thee forever, to live in my soul; Break down ev'ry i dol, cast out ev'ry foe;  2. Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies, And help me to make a complete sacrifice; I give up myself,  and whatever I know;  3. Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat; I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet, By faith, for my cleans ing, I see Thy blood flow;  4. Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait; Come now, and within me a new heart create; To those who have sought  Thee, Thou never said'st No;  wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow; Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
