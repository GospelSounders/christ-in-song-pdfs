. Down life's dark vale we wander, Till Jesus comes; We watch and wait and wonder, Till Jesus comes. 2. Oh, may my lamp be burning When Jesus comes; For Him my soul be yearning When Jesus comes. 3. No more heartpangs nor sadness, When Jesus comes; All peace and joy and gladness, When Jesus comes. 4. All doubts and fears will vanish, When Jesus comes; All gloom His face will banish, When Jesus comes. 5. He'll know the way was dreary, When Jesus comes; He'll know the feet grew weary, When Jesus comes. 6. He'll know what griefs oppressed me, When Jesus comes; Oh, how His arms will rest me! When Jesus comes. All joy His lov'd ones bringing, When Jesus comes; All praise thro' heaven ringing, When Jesus comes. All beauty bright and vernal, When Jesus comes; All glory, grand, eternal, When Jesus comes.
