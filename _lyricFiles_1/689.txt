. My Maker and my King, To Thee my all I owe; Thy sov'reign bounty is the spring Whence all my blessings flow; Thy sov'reign bounty is the spring Whence all my blessings  flow. 2. The creature of Thy hand, On Thee alone I live; My God, Thy benefits demand More praise than I can give; My God, Thy benefits demand More praise than I can  give. 3. Lord, what can I impart When all is Thine before? Thy love demands a thankful heart; The gift, alas! how poor. Thy love demands a thankful heart; The gift, alas! how  poor. 4. O! let Thy grace inspire My soul with strength divine; Let ev'ry word and each desire And all my days be Thine; Let ev'ry word and each desire And all my days be  Thine.
