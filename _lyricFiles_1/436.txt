. I've  found the Pearl of greatest  price! My  heart doth sing for  joy;  And  sing I must, for Christ is  mine! He  shall my song employ,  He shall my song employ. 2. Christ  is my Prophet, Priest, and  King: My  Prophet full of  light,  My  great High Priest before the  throne, My  King of heav'nly might,  My King of heav'nly might. 3. Christ  is my peace; He died for  me, For  me He shed His  blood;  And  as my wondrous Sacri fice, Offered Himself to God,  Offered Himself to God. 4. Christ  Jesus is my all in  all, My  comfort and my  love;  My  life below, and He shall  be My  joy and crown above, My joy and crown above.
