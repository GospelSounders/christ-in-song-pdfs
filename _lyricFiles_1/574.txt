. Gladly, gladly, toiling for the Master, Go we forth with willing hands to do Whatsoe'er to us He hath appointed, Faithfully our mission we'll pursue. 2. Joyful, joyful, we will tell the story Of His love to mortals here below; Christ, the brightness of the Father's glory, Freely here His blessing will bestow. 3. Meekly, meekly, following the Master, Walking faithfully the path He trod; Leading wand'rers to the dear Redeemer, Pointing sinners to the Lamb of God. Toiling for Jesus, Joyfully we go, joyfully we go; Toiling for Jesus, Toil ing,toiling for the Mas ter,    yes, joyfully we go; Toil ing,toiling for the Mas ter,In His vineyard here below.
