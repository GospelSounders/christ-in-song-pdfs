When . we lay  our burdens down, Sometime,  sometime;  When we take  the harp and crown, In that city of renown, We shall sing   sometime,  Sometime,    sometime.  We shall sing,   sometime,  We shall sing,   sometime,  We 2. shall meet  to part no more, Sometime, sometime;  On that blest  immortal shore, Where the reign  of death is o'er, We shall meet   sometime,  Sometime,    sometime,  We shall meet,   sometime,  We shall meet,   sometime,  In 3. that bright  eternal day— Sometime, sometime,  Tears shall all be wiped away, And we nev er more shall say, We shall sing   sometime,  Sometime,    sometime,  We shall sing,   sometime,  We shall sing,   sometime,  Where the heart  is never sad, Where the dwellers all are glad,         We shall sing,   sometime,
