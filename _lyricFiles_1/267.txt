. As with  gladness men of old Did the guiding star behold; As with  joy they hail'd its light, Leading onward, beaming bright; So, most gracious Lord, may bring, we Evermore be led to Thee.  2. As with joyful steps they sped To that lowly mangerbed, There to  bend the knee before Him whom heav'n and earth adore; So may we with willing  feet Ever seek the mercy seat. 3. As they offered gifts most rare At that manger rude and bare; So may  we with holy joy, Pure and free from sin's alloy, All our costliest treasures   Christ, to Thee, our heav'nly King.  4. Holy Jesus, ev'ry day Keep us in the narrow way; And, when  earthly things are past, Bring our ransomed souls at last Where they need no star to guide,  Where no clouds Thy glory  hide.
