. O Jesus, I have  promised To serve  Thee to the end; Be Thou forever near me, My Master and my Friend; I shall not fearI the  battle If Thou  art by my side, Nor wander from the pathway If Thou wilt be my Guide. O 2. let me feel Thou  near me, The world  is ever near; I see the sights that dazzle, The tempting sounds I hear; My foes are ever  near me, Around  me and within; But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer, And shield my soul from sin. 3. O Jesus, Thou hast  promised To all  who follow Thee That where Thou art in glory There shall Thy servant be; And, Jesus,  have  promised To serve  Thee to the end; O give me grace to follow My Master and my Friend.
