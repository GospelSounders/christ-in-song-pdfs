. I  will  never, nev er  leave thee, I  will  never thee forsake; I  will  guide, and save,  and  keep thee, For  My  name and mercy's sake; Fear no evil, Fear no evil, On ly  all My  counsel take. 2. When  the storm is rag ing  round thee, Call  on Me in humble pray'r; I  will  fold My arms  a bout thee, Guard  thee  with the tend'rest care: In the trial, In the tri al, I  will  make thy  pathway clear. 3. When  the  sky above  is  glowing, And  a round thee all is bright, Pleas ure  like a river  flowing, All  things  tending to delight; I'll be with thee, I'll be with  thee, I  will  guide thy  steps aright. 4. When  thy  soul is dark  and clouded, Fill'd with  doubt, and grief and care, Thro'  the  mists by which  'tis shrouded, I  will make a light appear, And the banner, And the ban ner Of  My  love I  will uprear.
