. Crowded is your heart with cares, Have you no room for Jesus? Captured by earth's gilded snares, Have you no room for Jesus? Lo! He's standing at  your door, Knocking, knocking, o'er  and o'er; Hear Him pleading evermore; Have you no room for Jesus? 2. Wasting all your precious hours, Have you no work for Jesus? Spending those Godgiven pow'rs, Have you no work for Jesus? Striving not to con quer sin, Seeking not a soul  to win, Bringing not a wand'rer in; Have you no work for Jesus? 3. Seeking earth's possessions fair, Have you no time for Jesus? None for gracious deeds to spare, Have you no time for Jesus? Worldly pleasures, wealth  and ease, Seeking, grasping toys  like these, Striving only self to please; Have you no time for Jesus? 4. Bearing only worthless leaves, Have you no fruit for Jesus? In your hands no precious sheaves, Have you no fruit for Jesus? Not a grain to store  away, Naught your labor to  repay, Not a joy for that great day When you shall meet with Jesus.
