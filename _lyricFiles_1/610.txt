I am passing down the valley that they say is so lone, But I find that all the pathway is with flowers o'ergrown. 'Tis to me the vale of Beulah, 'tis a beautiful way, For the Saviour walks beside me, my companion all day. Not a shadow, not a shadow ever darkens the way, For a radiance of rare glory shines upon it all day: And the music, sweetly chanted by the heavenly throng, Floats in cadence down the valley, and it cheers me along. So I journey with rejoicing toward the city of light, While each day my joy is deeper, and the path grows more bright. And I near the open portals of the kingdom above, For the highway leads to heaven, to the kingdom of love. Vale of Beulah, Vale of Beulah, Thou art precious to me; For the lovely land of promise In the distance I see.
