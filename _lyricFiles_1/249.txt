. Do you know what the dewdrops say,  As they 2. Do you know what the sunbeams bright,  Are sing3. Do you know what the soft rain tells,  As it 4. Do you know what the winds proclaim,  As they sparkle at break of day?  It is "Love, love, love, Our God is a God  of love;"  It is "Love, love, love, Our God is a God of love."
