. When I can read my title clear, When I can read my title clear, When  I can read my title clear,   To mansions in the skies, I'll bid farewell to ev'ry fear, I'll bid farewell to ev'ry fear, I'll  bid farewell to ev'ry fear,   And wipe my weeping eyes. 2. Should earth against my soul engage, Should earth against my soul engage, Should  earth against my soul engage,   And fiery darts be hurled; Then I can smile at Satan's rage, Then I can smile at Satan's rage, Then  I can smile at Satan's rage,   And face a frowning world. 3. Let cares like a wild deluge come, Let cares like a wild deluge come, Let  cares like a wild deluge come,   And storms of sorrow fall; May I but safely reach my home, May I but safely reach my home, May  I but safely reach my home,   My God, my heaven, my all. 4. There shall I bathe my weary soul, There shall I bathe my weary soul, There  shall I bathe my weary soul   In seas of heavenly rest, And not a wave of trouble roll, And not a wave of trouble roll, And  not a wave of trouble roll   Across my peaceful breast. We will stand the  storm, We will anchor by and by, by and by; We will stand the  storm, We will anchor by and  by.    the storm. It will not be very long, We will an chorby and by, We will an chorby and by;   the storm. It will not be very long,  anchor by and   by and by.
