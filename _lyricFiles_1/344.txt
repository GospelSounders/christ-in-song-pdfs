. How tedious and tasteless the hours When Jesus no longer I see! Sweet prospects, sweetI birds, and sweet flow'rs, Have all lost their sweetness to me; The midsummer sun shines but dim, The fields strive in vain to look gay; But when I am happy in Him, December's as pleasant as May. 2. His name yields the richest perfume, And sweeter than music His voice; His prescence disperses my gloom, And makes all within me rejoice: I should, were He always thus nigh, Have nothing to wish or to fear; No mortal so happy as I, My summer would last all the year. 3. My Lord, if indeed I am Thine, If Thou art my Sun and my Song, Say, why do languish and pine? And why are my winters so long? O drive these dark clouds from my sky, Thy soulcheering prescence restore; Or take me to Thee up on high, Where winter and clouds are no more.
