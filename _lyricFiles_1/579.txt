. If I were a sunbeam, This is what I'd do,—  I'd find the dark places, Searching the forest through;  I would kiss the pale flowers, Bending low at my feet,  Till each lonely blossom Open'd fair and sweet.  2. So many dark places In this world of sin,  Why not be a sunbeam, Letting the lovelight in,—  God's  beautiful lovelight,— Smiles and words  of cheer:  Kindness is the sunshine We should scatter here.  3. If we are like Jesus— Sun of Righteousness—  Who left the bright mansions, Lone ly lives to bless,  'Twill be sweet est pleasure Of His love  to tell,  Shining out His gladness Where the sad ones dwell.  Beautiful sunbeam! God sent you here;  I'll  be a sunbeam, *Lonely hearts to cheer.
