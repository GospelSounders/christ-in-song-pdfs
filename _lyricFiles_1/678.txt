. Faith of our fa thers! liv ing still, In spite of dungeon, fire  and sword: O how our hearts  beat high  with joy Whene'er we hear that glorious word: 2. Our fathers, chained in pris ons dark, Were still in heart and con science free: How sweet would be  their chil dren's fate, If they, like them, could die  for Thee! 3. Faith of our fa thers, we  will love Both friend and foe in all  our strife: And preach Thee, too,  as love  knows how, By kindly words and vir tuous life.      holy faith! We will be true to thee till death!
