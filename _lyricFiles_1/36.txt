###“...Ask, and ye shall receive...” (John 16:24).
1. 'Twas in the days of careless youth, when life was fair and bright, 
And ne'er a tear, and scarce a fear o'er cast my day and night, 
As, in the quiet eventide, I pass'd her kneeling there, 
That just one word, my name, I heard my name in mother's pray'r. 

2. I thought but little of it then, tho' rev'rence touch'd my heart, 
To her whose love sought from above for me the better part; 
But when life's sterner battles came with many a subtle snare, 
Oft that one word, in thought I heard my name in mother's pray'r. 

3. I wandered on, and heeded not God's oft repeated call 
To turn from sin, to live for Him, and trust to Him my all; 
But when at last, convinced of sin, I sank in deep despair, 
My hope awoke, when mem'ry spoke my name in mother's pray'r. 

4. That pleading heart, that soul so tried, has gone into her rest, 
But still with me for aye shall be the mem'ry of her trust. 
And when I cross the Jordan's tide, and meet her over there, 
We'll praise the Lord, who bless'd that word, my name in mother's pray'r. 

CHORUS.
My name in mother's pray'r, My name in mother's pray'r, 
That just one word, my name I heard, 
I heard my name (My name) in mother's pray'r.
