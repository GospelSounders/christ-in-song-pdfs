. Jesus, I will follow Thee, For I hear Thee calling me; Loving, trusting, glad I come, To let Thee lead me home. 2. Little eyes might lose the way, Little feet might go astray; I might weak and weary be, But Thou art strong for me. 3. Grief and want may be my foes, Foolish sins my way oppose; Full of courage I will be, Whene'er I follow Thee. I will follow Thee, I will follow Thee, I will follow Thee Wherever Thou dost lead.
