###“If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in...” (Revelation 3:20)
1. If you are tired of the load of your sin, 
Let Jesus come into your heart; 
If you desire a new life to begin, 
Let Jesus come into your heart.

2. If 'tis for purity now that you sigh, 
Let Jesus come into your heart; 
Fountains for cleansing are flowing near by, 
Let Jesus come into your heart.

3. If there's a tempest your voice cannot still, 
Let Jesus come into your heart; 
If there's a void this world never can fill, 
Let Jesus come into your heart. 

4. If friends, once trusted, have proven untrue, 
Let Jesus come into your heart; 
Find what a Friend He will be unto you. 
Let Jesus come into your heart. 

5. If you would join the glad songs of the blest, 
Let Jesus come into your heart: 
If you would enter the mansions of rest, 
Let Jesus come into your heart.

CHORUS.
Just now, your doubtings give o'er; 
Just now, reject Him no more; 
Just now, throw open the door; 
Let Jesus come into your heart. 
(Final)Just now, my doubtings are o'er; 
Just now, rejecting no more; 
Just now, I open the door, 
And Jesus comes into my heart.
