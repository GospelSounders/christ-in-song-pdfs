. Come, Thou almighty King, Help us Thy name   to sing, Help us to praise. Father allglorious, O'er all victorious, Come, and reign over us, Ancient of Days. 2. Come, holy Com forter, Thy sacred wit  ness bear In this glad hour: Thou who almighty art, Rule now in ev'ry heart, And ne'er from us depart, Spirit of pow'r. 3. Thou are the mighty One, On earth Thy will   be done, From shore to shore. Thy sov'reign majesty May we in glory see, And to eternity Love and adore.
