. I heard a voice, the sweetest voice That ever mortal heard; O how it made my heart rejoice, And every feeling stirred! 'Twas Jesus spoke to me so mild; He called me to His side, And said, although with heart defiled, I might in Him confide. 2. I saw His face, the fairest face that ever mortal saw; I longed the Saviour to embrace, From Him new life to draw. "Come unto Me," He kindly said, "And I will give thee rest; The ransomprice I fully paid; Repent! believe! be blest! " 3. I felt His love, the strongest love That mortal ever felt; O, how it drew my soul above, And made my hard heart melt! My burden at His feet I laid, And knew the joy of heaven, As in my willing ear He said The blessed word, "Forgiven! "
