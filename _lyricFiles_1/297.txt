.More love to Thee, O Christ! More love to Thee; Hear Thou the pray'r I make On bended knee. 2.Once earthly joy I craved, Sought peace and rest; Now Thee alone I seek, Give what is best. 3.Let sorrow do its work, Send grief or pain; Sweet are Thy messengers, Sweet their refrain, 4.Then shall my latest breath, Whisper Thy praise; This be the parting cry My heart shall raise, This is my earnest plea, More love, O Christ, to Thee, More love to Thee! More love to Thee!
