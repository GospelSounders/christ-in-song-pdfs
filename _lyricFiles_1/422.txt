. All things are Thine; no gift have we, Lord of all gifts! to offer Thee; And hence, with grateful hearts today, Thine own, before Thy feet  we lay. 2. Thy will was in the builders' tho't; Thy hand unseen amidst  us wrought; Thro' mortal motive, scheme, and plan, Thy wise, eternal pur pose ran. 3. No lack Thy perfect fulness knew; For human needs and long ings grew This house of prayer— this home of rest Here may Thy saints be of ten blest. 4. O Father! deign these walls to bless, Make this th'abode of right eousness, And let these doors a gateway be To lead us from ourselves  to Thee.
