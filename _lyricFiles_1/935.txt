. O'er the distant mountain breaking, Comes the red'ning dawn of day; Rise, my soul, from sleep awaking, Rise, and sing, and watch, and pray; 'Tis the Saviour, 'Tis the Saviour On His bright returning way. 2. O Thou longexpected! weary Waits my anxious soul for Thee; Life is dark, and earth is dreary Where Thy light I do not see: O my Sav iour, O my Sav iour, When wilt Thou return to me? 3. Long, too long, in sin and sadness, Far away from Thee I pine; When, O when, shall I the gladness Of Thy Spirit feel in mine? O my Sav iour, O my Sav iour, When shall I be wholly Thine? 4. Nearer is my soul's salvation, Spent the night, the day at hand; Keep me in my lowly station, Watching for Thee, till I stand, O my Sav iour, O my Sav iour, In Thy bright and promised land. 5. With my lamp welltrimm'd and burning, Swift to hear, and slow to roam, Watching for Thy glad returning To restore me to my home; Come, my Sav iour, Come, my Sav iour, O my Saviour, quickly come!
