. How firm a foundation, ye saints  of the Lord,  Is laid for your faith  in His excellent word! What more can He say than to you He hath said   Who unto the Saviour for refuge have fled,  Who unto the Saviour for refuge have fled? 2. "When thro' the deep waters I call  thee to go,  The rivers of sor row shall not overflow; For I will be with thee, thy troub les to bless,   And sanc tify to thee thy deep est distress,  And sanc tify to thee thy deepest distress." 3. "When thro' fiery trials thy path way shall lie,  My grace allsuffi cient shall be thy supply; The flame shall not hurt thee; I on ly design   Thy dross to consume, and thy gold  to refine,  Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine." 4. "The soul that on Jesus doth lean  for repose,  I will not, I will  not desert to its foes; That soul, tho' all hell should endeav or to shake,   I'll nev er, no never, no nev er forsake,  I'll nev er, no never, no never forsake."
