. Unshaken as the sacred hills, And fix'd as mountains stand; Firm as a rock the soul shall rest That trusts th' Almighty hand. 2. Not walls nor hills could guard so well Fair Salem's happy ground, As those eternal arms of love That ev'ry saint surround. 3. Do good, O Lord, do good to those Who cleave to Thee in heart, Who on Thy truth alone repose, Nor from Thy law depart.
