. My blessed Lord was crucified; The day was dark and grief was wide; For hope was crushed, and all seemed vain, Until the Saviour rose again. 2. He brings His great salvation nigh, And on His love bids us rely; He bought our peace thro' grief and pain; But oh! He did not die in vain! 3. O, wondrous news of life and love! That Jesus lives and reigns above; He made the path of glory plain; Ah, no! He did not die in vain!        gain! Oh! bear aloft the strain; The mighty Lord is risen in pow'r; He died, but not in vain.
