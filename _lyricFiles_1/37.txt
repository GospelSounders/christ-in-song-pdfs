###“He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life...” (John 3:36)
1. "Eternity! — where?" It  floats in the air; 
Amid clamor or silence it ever is there! 
The you question so solemn— "Eternity! — where?" 
The you question so solemn— "Eternity! — where?" 

2. "Eternity! — where?" Oh! Eternity! — where? 
With redeemed ones in glory? or lost in despair? 
'Tis  one or the other— "Eternity! — where?" 
'Tis  one or the other— "Eternity! — where?" 

3. "Eternity! — where?" Oh!  how can you share 
The  world's giddy pleasures, or heedlessly dare 
Do  aught till you settle— "Eternity! — where?" 
Do  aught till you settle— "Eternity! — where?" 

4. "Eternity! — where?" Oh!  friend, have a care; 
Soon  God will no longer His judgment forbear; 
This  day may decide your— "Eternity! — where?" 
This  day may decide your— "Eternity! — where?" 

5. "Eternity! — where?" Oh! Eternity— where? 
Friend,  sleep not, nor take in the world any share, 
Till  answer this question— "Eternity! — where?" 
Till  answer this question— "Eternity! — where?"
