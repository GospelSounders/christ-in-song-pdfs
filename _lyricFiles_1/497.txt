. Moment by moment, hour  by hour,  Constantly trusting His keeping pow'r;  Day by day and week by week,  Only His praise my tongue shall speak.  2. Why for the body anx ious tho't? Knowing He careth, sweet is my lot;  Mine is the asking, His  the store, Moment by moment, o'er and o'er.  3. Why should the spirit doubt ing weep? What I've committed, surely He'll keep;  Mine is the trusting, His  the pow'r, Moment by moment, hour by hour.  4. Why for the resting sing  or sigh,  Selfishly seeking mansions on high?  Earth needeth more of ho ly love, Than all the universe above.  Moment by moment, Helper is He,  Moment by moment dwelling in me;  Gently subduing powers of sin,  Wonderful Saviour is Christ within.
