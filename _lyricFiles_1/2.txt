WHITE LEAVES
“...A just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again...” (Proverbs 24:16).
“...Hope thou in God...” (Psalm 42:5). He “is able to keep you from falling...” (Jude 24).
F.E.B.	F.E.Belden

1. White pages before us, thank God this is so;  
Past errors forgiven, wash'd whiter than snow;  
O'er sinblotted record why sorrowing more?  
Confess to the Father, white leaves are before.

2. Forgiven, forgotten, Christ covers from view,  
And strength for the future, gives daily anew;  
All offers He freely for thy sinful heart:  
This, this must be yielded, all, all, not a part. 

3. Despondent one wounded by treacherous foe,  
In moment unguarded by sin smitten low;  
Defeated; yet never surrender Christ's name,  
Take courage and speak it, deliverance claim. 

4. Then faithful in service, from hour unto hour,  
By full consecration draw fulness of pow'r;  
His oil of love burning gives out the true light,  
The life to Him yielded hath pages of white.  


Chorus.
White leaves, 
( - Beautiful leaves from heav'n),
fair leaves
(- Moments in mercy giv'n), 
New days of trial  for him who grieves; 
Life leaves,
(- One more probation hour),  
free leaves
(- Promise of holy pow'r). 
What shall be written on life's new leaves? 
What shall be written on our white leaves? (snow white leaves)
