. Lord, I hear of show'rs of blessing Thou art scatt'ring full and free; Show'rs the thirsty soul refreshing; Let some drops now fall on me; 2. Pass me not, O gracious Father! Sinful though my heart may be; Thou might'st leave me, but the rather Let Thy mercy rest on me. 3. Have I long in sin been sleeping? Long been slighting, grieving Thee? Has the world my heart been keeping? O forgive and rescue me! 4. Pass me not, O Holy Spirit! Thou canst make the blind to see; Testify of Jesus' merit, Speak the word of peace to me. Even me, even me, Let some drops now fall on me.
