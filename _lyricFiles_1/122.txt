. The Lord first empties whom He fills, Casts down whom He would raise;  He quickens when the letter kills, Exalting thus His praise.  When He applies His healing blood Unto a sin sick soul,  This balsam, pow'rful, precious, good, Ne'er fails to make it whole.  2. On us He spent His life and blood, Our losses to retrieve;  Mankind's redemption now holds good For sinners who believe.  Lord, I believe! whate'er befall, A thankful heart  be mine,—  A heart that answers to Thy call,— One that is wholly Thine.
