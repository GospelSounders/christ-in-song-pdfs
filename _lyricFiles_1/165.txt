. Come to the living waters, come! Obey your Maker's call; Return, ye weary wand'rers, home; My grace is free for all, My grace is free for all. 2. Nothing ye in exchange shall give; Leave all you have behind; Freely the gift of God receive, And peace in Jesus find, And peace in Jesus find. 3. I bid you all My goodness prove; My promises are free: Come, taste the manna of My love, Delight your souls in Me, Delight your souls in Me.
