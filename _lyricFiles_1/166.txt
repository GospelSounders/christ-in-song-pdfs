. O for that flame of living fire Which shone so bright in saints  of old; Which bade their souls to heav'n aspire, Calm in distress, in  danger bold! 2. Where is that spirit, Lord, which dwelt In Abram's breast, and sealed  him Thine? Which made Paul's heart with sorrow melt, And glow with en ergy divine? 3. Is not Thy grace as mighty now As when Elijah felt  its pow'r? When glory beamed from Moses' brow, Or Job endured the  trying hour? 4. Remember, Lord, the ancient days; Renew Thy work, Thy grace  restore; And while to Thee our hearts we raise, On us Thy Ho ly  Spirit pour.
