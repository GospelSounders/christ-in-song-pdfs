###“Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me” (Revelation 3:20).
1. Christ is knocking at my sad heart; Shall I let Him in?  
Patiently pleading with my sad heart; O shall I let Him in?  
Cold and proud is my heart with sin, Dark and cheerless is all within; 
Christ is bidding me turn unto Him; O shall I let Him in?

2. Shall I send Him the loving word? Shall I let Him in?  
Meekly accepting my gracious Lord, O shall I let Him in?  
He can infinite love impart, He can pardon this rebel heart; 
Shall I bid Him forever depart, Or shall I let Him in? 

3. Yes, I'll open this heart's proud door ((proud heart's door)), Yes, I'll let Him in.  
Gladly I'll welcome Him evermore; O, yes, I'll let Him in.  
Blessed Saviour, abide with me, Cares and trials will lighter be; 
I am safe if I'm only with Thee, O, blessed Lord, come in!
