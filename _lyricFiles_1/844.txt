. Thou coming One, our wants relieve In this our evil day;  To all Thy tempted followers give The pow'r to watch and pray.  Long as our fiery trials last, Long as the cross we bear,  O may our souls on Thee be cast, In allprevailing pray'r.  2. The pow'r of interceding grace Give us in faith to claim;  To wrestle till we see Thy face, And know Thy hidden name.  Till then Thy perfect love impart, Till Thou appear  below  Be this the cry of ev'ry heart,— "I will not let Thee go."  3. I will not let Thee go, unless Thou tell Thy name to me;  With all Thy great salvation bless, And make me all like Thee.  Then shall I on the mountaintop Behold Thy open face,  Where faith in sight is swallowed up, And prayer in joyful praise.
