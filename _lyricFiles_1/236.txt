. I have a song  I  love to sing, Since I have been redeem'd;   Of my Redeem er,  Saviour, King, Since I have been redeem'd. 2. I have a Christ  that  satisfies, Since I have been redeem'd;   To do His will  my  highest prize, Since I have been redeem'd. 3. I have a wit ness  bright and clear, Since I have been redeem'd;   Dispelling ev 'ry  doubt and fear, Since I have been redeem'd. 4. I have a home  prepared for me, Since I have been redeem'd; Where I shall dwell  eternally, Since I have been redeem'd.    have been redeem'd,    deem'd,     Since  I have been redeem'd, I will glory in His name; Since  I     have been redeem'd,     I will glory in my Saviour's name.
