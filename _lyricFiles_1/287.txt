. Saviour, keep me pure in heart,  By Thy pow'r renewing; Seal my life of Thine a part,  All my tho'ts bedewing. 2. In Thy sinless life I see  Matchless grace and beau ty: Perfect Pattern, guide for me,  Teaching love for du ty. 3. One with Thee! thus would I live,  Till the morn immor tal; Thus myself for others give,—  With them pass the por tal. Pure in heart,  pure in heart,—  Jesus, only giver; Seal my life of Thine a part,  Here and then forever.
