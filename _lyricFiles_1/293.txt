. In the blood from the cross I have been wash'd from sin;  But to be free from dross Still I would enter in.  2. Day by day, hour by hour Blessings are sent to me;  But for more of His pow'r Ever my pray'r shall be.  3. Near to Christ I would live, Following Him each day;  What I ask He will give, So then with faith I pray.  4. Now I have peace, sweet peace, While in this world of sin;  But to pray I'll not cease Till I am pure within.  Deeper yet, deeper yet, Into the crimson flood;  Deeper yet, deeper yet, Under the precious blood.
