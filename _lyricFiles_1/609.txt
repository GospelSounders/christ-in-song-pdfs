. I need Thee every hour, Most gracious  Lord; No tender voice like Thine Can peace afford. 2. I need Thee every hour; Stay Thou  nearby; Temptations lose their pow'r When Thou art  nigh. 3. I need Thee every hour, In joy or  pain; Come quickly and abide, Or life  is  vain. 4. I need Thee every hour; Teach me  Thy  will, And Thy rich promises In me  fulfil. 5. I need Thee every hour, Most Ho ly  One; O make me Thine indeed, Thou blessed  Son. I need Thee, O I need Thee! Every hour I need Thee; O bless me now, my Saviour! I come  to Thee.
