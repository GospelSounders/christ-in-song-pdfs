. Come, Thou Fount of ev'ry blessing, Tune my heart to sing Thy grace; Streams of mercy, never ceasing, Call for songs of loudest praise. Teach me  ever to adore  Thee, May I  still Thy goodness prove, While the hope of endless glory Fills my heart with joy and love. 2. Here I raise my Ebenezer, Hither by Thy help I've come, And I hope by Thy good pleasure Safely to arrive at home. Jesus  sought me when a stran ger, Wand'ring  from the fold of God; He to rescue me from danger Interposed His precious blood. 3. O, to grace how great a debtor Daily I'm constrained to be! Let Thy goodness like a fetter Bind me closer still to Thee. Prone to  wander, Lord, I feel  it,— Prone to  leave the God I love,— Here's my heart, O, take and seal it; Seal it for Thy courts above.
