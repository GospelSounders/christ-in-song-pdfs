. On the mountain top appearing, Lo! the sacred herald stands, Welcome news to Zion bearing— Zion, long in hostile lands: Mourning cap'rance, tive! Mourning captive! God Himself shall loose thy bands. 2. Has thy night been long and mournful? Have thy friends unfaithful proved? Have thy foes been proud and scornful, By thy sighs and tears unmoved? Cease thy mourn ing; Cease thy mourn ing; Zion still is well belov'd. 3. God, thy God will now restore thee; He Himself appears thy friend; All thy foes shall flee before thee; Here their boasts and triumphs end: Great deliv  Great deliv 'rance Zion's King will surely send.
