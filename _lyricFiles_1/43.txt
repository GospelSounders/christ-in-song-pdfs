##WHEN THE KING COMES IN

###“Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world” (Matthew 25:34).
1. Called to the feast by the King are we, 
Sitting, perhaps, where His people be; 
How will it fare, friend, with thee and me When the King comes in? 

2. Crowns on the head where the thorns have been, 
Glorified He who once died for men; 
Splendid the vision before us then, 
When the King comes in. 

3. Like lightning's flash will that instant show 
Things hidden long from both friend and foe; 
Just what we are will each neighbor know,
 When the King comes in. 

4. Joyful His eye shall on each one rest 
Who is in white wedding garments dress'd; 
Ah! well for us if we stand the test, 
When the King comes in. 

5. Endless the sad separation then, 
Bitter the cry of deluded men, 
Awful that moment of anguish when 
Christ the King comes in. 

6. Lord, grant us all, we implore Thee, grace, 
So to await Thee, each in his place, 
That we may fear not to see Thy face 
When Thou comest in. 

REFRAIN.
When the King comes  in, brother, When the  King comes in! 
How will it fare with thee and me When the King comes in?
