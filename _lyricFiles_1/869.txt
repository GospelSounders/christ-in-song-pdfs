. We shall walk with Him in white, In that country pure and bright, Where shall enter naught that may defile; Where the daybeam ne'er declines, For the blessed light that shines Is the glory of a Saviour's smile. 2. We shall walk with Him in white, Where faith yields to blissful sight, When the beauty of the King we see; Holding converse full and sweet, In a fellowship complete; Waking songs of holy melody. 3. We shall walk with Him in white, By the fountains of delight, Where the Lamb His ransomed ones shall lead; For His blood shall wash each stain, Till no spot of sin remain, And the soul forevermore is freed. Beau tiful robes,  Beau tiful robes,  Beau tiful robes we then shall wear;  Gar ments of light,  Love ly and bright,  Beau tiful robes,   beau tiful robes, Beau tiful robes,   beau tiful robes, Beau tiful robes  we then shall wear, Beau tiful robes we then shall wear. Gar-ments of light,   gar mentsof light, Love lyand bright,   love lyand bright, Walking with Jesus in white, Beautiful robes we shall wear.
