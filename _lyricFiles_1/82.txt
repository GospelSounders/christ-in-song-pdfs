. Behold, behold the Lamb  of God, ry On the cross,  on the cross;  For you He shed His pre cious blood, ry, On the cross,  on the cross;  O hear His agonizing cry,  "Eloi, lama,  sabachthani,"  Draw near, and see your Sav iour die,  On the cross,  on the cross.  2. Behold His arms extend ed wide,  On the cross,  on the cross;  Behold His bleeding hands  and side,  On the cross,  on the cross;  The sun withholds his rays of light, The heav'ns are clothed in shades of night,  While Jesus doth for sin ners fight,  On the cross,  on the cross.  3. And now the mighty deed  is done,  On the cross,  on the cross; The battle fought, the vic t'ry won,  On the cross,  on the cross;  "'Tis finished," now  the Saviour cries;  To heav'n He turns  His languid eyes;  Then bows His sacred head,  and dies,  On the cross,  on the cross.  4. Wheree'er I go, I'll tell  the sto Of the cross,  of the cross;  In nothing else my soul  shall glo Save the cross,  save the cross;  And this my con stant theme shall be,  Thro' time and in  eternity,  That Jesus shed His blood  for me,  On the cross,  on the cross.
