. Are you weary, are you heavy hearted? Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus; Are you grieving over joys departed? 2. Do the tears flow down your cheeks unbidden? Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus; Have you sins that to the world are hidden? 3. Do you fear the gath'ring clouds of sorrow? Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus; Are you anxious what shall be tomorrow? 4. Are you troubled at the tho't of dying? Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus; For Christ's coming kingdom are you sighing? Tell it to Jesus alone. Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus, He is a friend that's well known; You've no other such a friend or brother, Tell it to Jesus alone.
