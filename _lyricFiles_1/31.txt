###“...Thou art my help and my deliverer...” (Psalm 40:17).
1. O  hear my cry, be gracious now to me, 
Come, Great Deliv'rer,  come; 
My  soul bowed down is longing now for Thee, 
Come, Great Deliv'rer,  come.

2. I  have no place, no shelter from the night, 
Come, Great Deliv'rer,  come; 
One  look from Thee would give me life and light, 
Come, Great Deliv'rer,  come. 

3. My  path is lone, and weary are my feet, 
Come, Great Deliv'rer,  come; 
Mine  eyes look up Thy loving smile to meet, 
Come, Great Deliv'rer,  come. 

4. Thou  wilt not spurn contrition's broken sigh, 
Come, Great Deliv'rer,  come; 
Regard my prayer, and hear my humble cry, 
Come, Great Deliv'rer,  come. 

I've wander'd far away o'er mountains cold, 
I've wander'd far away from home;  
O  take me now, and bring me to Thy fold, 
Come, Great Deliv'rer,  come.
