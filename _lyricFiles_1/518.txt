. As of old when the hosts of Israel Were compell'd in the wilderness to dwell, Trusting they in their God to lead the way To the light of perfect day. 2. To and fro as a ship without a sail, Not a compass to guide them thro' the vale, But the sign of their God was ever near, Thus their fainting hearts to cheer. 3. All the days of their wand'rings they were fed To the land of the promise they were led; By the hand of the Lord, in guidance sure, They were bro't to Cannan's shore. So the sign of the fire by night, And the sign of the cloud by day, Hov'ring o'er, justb fore, Asthey  journey on their way, Shall a guide and a leader be, Till the wilness be past,  the Lord our God in His own good time  lead to the light at last.
