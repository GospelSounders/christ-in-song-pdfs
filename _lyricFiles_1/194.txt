. I will sing (I will sing) of Jesus' love, Sing of Him (sing of Him) who first loved me; For He left (for He left) bright worlds above, And  died on Calvary. 2. Ere a tear (ere a tear) had dim'd mine eyes, Jesus' tears (Je sus'tears) for me did flow; Ere my first (ere my first) faint prayer could rise, He had prayed in tones of woe. 3. O the depths (O the depths) of love divine! Earth or heav'n (earth or can heav'n) never know How that sins (how that as sins) dark as mine Can be made as white as snow. 4. Nothing good (noth inggood) for Him I've done; How could He (how could such He) love bestow? Lord, I own (Lord, my I own) heart is won; Help me now my love to show. I will sing of  Jesus' love, Endless praise my  heart shall give; He has died  that I might live,— I will sing His love to me.
