.Where He may lead me I will go, For I have learned to trust Him so, And I remember 'twas for me, That He was slain on Calvary. 2.O I delight in His command, Love to be led by His dear hand, His divine will is sweet to me, Hallowed by bloodstained Calvary. 3.Onward I go, nor doubt, nor fear, Happy with Christ, my Saviour near, Trusting that I some day shall see Jesus my Friend, of Calvary. Jesus shall lead me night and day, Jesus shall lead me all the way, He is the truest Friend to me, For I remember Calvary.
