. I cease to sing of sweet tomorrow, With selfish thought to be away; There is a holier balm for sorrow, I find in Christ a sweet today. 2. I am so happy when I'm telling How great His pow'r, how great His love; Were there no praise where God is dwelling, It would be pain to live above. 3. If but to gain a home in glory The Saviour trod this earth alone, There ne'er had been a gospel story, He ne'er had left His royal throne. 4. His love is life, His love is heaven, Eternal life, eternal bliss; Accept it freely, be forgiven, And taste the future world in this. A risen Christ, a living Saviour, Not in the tomb where once He lay. Whene'er I tell His loving favor, Sweet by and by is ev'ry day.
