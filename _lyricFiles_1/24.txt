##CHRIST RECEIVETH SINFUL MEN
##Arr. from Neumaster
##F. E. Belden
###“...The Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners...” (Luke 15:2).
1. Sing it o'er and o'er again, 
Glorious message, clear and plain; 
'Tis today the same as then, 
Christ receiveth sinful men. 

2. "Seek and find," and "look and live;" 
Grace is free! proclaim to all 
Who the heav'nly pathway leave, 
All who linger, all who fall. 

3. Years of sin condemn us not, 
Pure before the law we stand; 
Jesus' blood removes each spot, 
Satisfies its full demand. 

4. He will take the sinfulest, 
Make the scarlet white and pure; 
Come, and He will give you rest; 
Trust His word, forever sure. 

5. In Thy righteous robe to shine, 
Lord, I come, and rest forgiv'n; 
Self is lost in love divine, 
Death in life, and earth in heav'n. 

CHORUS.
Wonderful word(&c), O sweet refrain (O sweet and glad refrain)! 
Christ receives (&c) sinful men (O praise His name! ) 
Message of mercy (&c), clear and plain (clear and pure and plain),— 
Christ receiveth sinful men (praise His name!)
