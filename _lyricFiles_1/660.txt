. My Jesus,  as Thou  wilt: O, may Thy  will be mine! Into Thy  hand of love I  would, my all  resign.  Thro' sorrow,  or thro' joy, Conduct me  as Thine own, And help me  still to say, "My  Lord, Thy will be done." 2. My Jesus,  as Thou  wilt: Tho' seen thro'  many a tear, Let not my  star of hope Grow  dim  or disappear.  Since Thou on  earth hast  wept, And sorrowed  oft alone, If I must  weep with Thee, "My  Lord, Thy will be done." 3. My Jesus,  as Thou  wilt: All shall be  well for me; Each changing  future scene I  glad ly trust with Thee.  Straight to my  home a bove, I travel  calmly on, And sing in  life or death, "My  Lord, Thy will be done."
