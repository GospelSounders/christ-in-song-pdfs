. Maker of land and roll ing sea, We dedicate this house to Thee; And what our willing hands  have done, We give to God and to  the Son. 2. Come, fill this house with heav'n ly grace, While sinners throng  the sac red place, And saints, with angel hosts  above, Unite to sing redeem ing love. 3. Here, let the mourning soul  find rest Upon the lov ing Sav iour's breast; And with the sense of sins forgiv'n, Each heart aspire to God  and heav'n.
