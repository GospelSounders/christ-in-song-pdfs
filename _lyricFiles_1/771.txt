. Zion awake! Thy slumber break; No longer in thy sins lie down; His garment of salvation take, His beauty and His strength put  on. 2. Shake off the dust that blinds thy sight, And hides the promise from  thine eyes; Arise, and struggle into light; The great Deliv'rer calls, Arise! 3. Vessels of mercy, sons of grace, Be purged from ev'ry sin ful stain; Be like your Lord, His Word embrace, Nor bear His hallow'd name in  vain.
