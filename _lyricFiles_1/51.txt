. All to Jesus I surrender, All to Him I freely give; I will ever love and trust Him, In His presence daily live; 2. All to Jesus I surrender, Humbly at His feet I bow; Worldly pleasures all forsaken, Take me, Jesus take me now; 3. All to Jesus I surrender, Make me, Saviour, wholly Thine; Let me feel the Holy Spirit, Truly know that Thou art mine; 4. All to Jesus I surrender, Now I feel the sacred flame. O the joy of full salvation! Glory, glory to His name! I surrender all, I surrender all; I sur ren derall,    I sur ren der all,All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all.
