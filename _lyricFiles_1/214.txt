. Awake, my  soul, and greet the dawn, sing Behold, the  dreary night is  gone; The sunless grave gives back its  prey, For Christ came forth at  break of  day. 2. Amazed were  they, the Roman guard, Who fast the sepulcher had barred,  To see how  vain the watch the  seal, When Jesus did  His  might re veal. 3. In lofty  strains let Zion   The praise of her triumphant  King; Captivi ty is captive  led, For Christ is ris en  from the  dead. Awake,   my  soul,  The Saviour lives, no  more to die, Awake,   my  soul,  The Awake, awake, awake my soul,  Saviour lives, no  Awake, awake, awake, my soul,  Lord ascends on high.
