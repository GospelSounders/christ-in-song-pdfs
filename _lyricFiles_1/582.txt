. Into the tent where a gypsy boy lay, Dying alone at the close of the day, News of Salvation we carried; said he, 2. "Did He so love me, a poor little boy? Send unto me the good tidings of joy? Need I not perish? my hand will He hold? 3. Bending, we caught the last words of his breath, Just as he entered the valley of death, "God sent His Son! " "whosoever," said he; 4. Smiling, he said, as his last sigh he spent, "I am so glad that for me He was sent! " Whispered, while low sank the sun in the west, "Nobody ever has told it to me! " Tell it again! tell it again! Salvation's story repeat o'er and o'er,  Till none can say of the children of men, "Nobody ever has told me before"
