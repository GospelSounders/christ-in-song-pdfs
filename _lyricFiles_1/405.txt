. By  cool Siloam's shady  rill How fair  the lil y grows! How sweet the breath, beneath  the hill, Of  Sharon's dew y rose! 2. Lo,  such the child whose early  feet The paths  of peace  have trod, Whose se cret heart, with  in fluence sweet, Is  upward drawn  to God. 3. Dependent on Thy bounteous  breath, We seek  Thy grace  alone, In child hood, manhood,  age,  and death, To  keep us still  Thine own.
