. O  that the  Lord would guide my ways To  keep His statutes  still! O  that my  God would  grant me grace To  know and do His will! 2. O  send Thy  spirit down to write Thy  law upon my  heart, Nor  let my tongue  indulge deceit, Nor  act the li ar's part. 3. From  vanity turn off my eyes, Let  no corrupt design Nor  cove tous desires arise Within this soul  of mine. 4. Order my  footsteps by Thy word, And  make my heart sincere; Let  sin have  no dominion, Lord, But  keep my con science clear.
