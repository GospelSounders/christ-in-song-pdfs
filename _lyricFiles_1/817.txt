. O God, beneath Thy  guiding  hand, Our exiled fathers  crossed the  sea; And when they trod the  wintry  strand, With pray'r and psalm they worshipped  Thee. 2. Truth, freedom, justice,  faith in  God, Came with those exiles  o'er the  waves; And where their pilgrim  feet have  trod, The God they trusted guards their  graves. 3. And here Thy name, O  God of  love, May we, their children,  still adore, Till these eternal  hills remove, And spring adorns the earth no  more.
