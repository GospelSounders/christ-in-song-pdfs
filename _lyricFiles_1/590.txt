Man . the lifeboat! Man the lifeboat! Strong and short above the roar, Sounds the order to the watchers On the tempestbeaten shore, Hark! again the guns appealing! Signals burn for swift relief; There are men and wives and children, Facing Man 2. the lifeboat! Man the lifeboat! Fog and night and cruel sea, All the odds of death against them, And eternal jeopardy. Thou, who bid'st us dare the surges, Stay us at the struggling oar! Nay! go with us to the rescue! Shall they Man 3. the lifeboat! Man the lifeboat! Courage, fellow men! 'tis He, Guiding us to your deliv'rance, Once that trod the Galilee! And the boat that carries Jesus, Floods of death shall not o'erwhelm; Scourging storms but urge us homeward; Life and Man 4. the lifeboat! Man the lifeboat! Think how once on breaking deck Thou didst stand aghast, till Jesus Bro't thee from the lurching wreck. To the oars then! O Redeemer, let Thy heart throb thro' our hand, Till the souls in mortal danger, Find thro' death on yonder reef! Man the lifeboat! Man the lifeboat! Help, for Christ's sake, them that drown! In the peril of great waters, Let them  not  go down!
