. Watch, ye saints, with eyelids waking; Lo! the powers of heav'n are shaking; Keep your lamps all trimm'd and burning, Ready for your Lord's returning. 2. Lo! the promise of your Saviour, Pardoned sin and purchased favor, Bloodwashed robes and crowns of glory; Haste to tell redemption's story. 3. Kingdoms at their base are crumbling, Hark! His chariot wheels are rumbling; Tell, O tell of grace abounding, Whilst the seventh trump is sounding. 4. Nations wane, tho' proud and stately; Christ His kingdom hasteneth greatly; Earth her latest pangs is summing; Shout, ye saints, your Lord is coming. 5. Sinners, come, while Christ is pleading; Now for you He's interceding; Haste, ere grace and time diminished Shall proclaim the mystery finished. Lo! He comes, lo! Jesus comes; Lo! He come, He comes all glorious! Jesus comes to reign victorious, Lo! He comes, yes, Jesus comes.
