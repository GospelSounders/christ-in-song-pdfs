. O Love!  how deep, how broad,  how high! It fills the heart  with ec stacy, That God, the Son of God, should  take  Our mor  tal form for mortals' sake. 2. For us  He was baptized,  and bore His ho ly fast,  and hungered sore; For us temptations sharp  He  knew;  For us   the tempter ov erthrew. 3. For us  He prayed, for us  He taught, For us  His dai ly works  He wrought, By words, and signs, and act ions  thus  Still seek  ing not Himself but us. 4. For us  to wicked men  betrayed, Scourged, mocked,  in pur ple robe  arrayed, He bore the shameful cross  and  death;  For us   at length gave up  His breath. 5. For us  He rose from death again, For us  He went  on high to reign, For us He sent His Spir it  here  To guide,   to strengthen, and  to cheer. 6. To Him  whose boundless love has won Salva tion for  us through  His Son, To God the Father, glo ry  be,  Both now   and through eter nity.
