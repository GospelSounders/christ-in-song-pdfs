. Rock of Ages, cleft for me! Let me hide myself in Thee; Let the water and the blood, From Thy riven side that flowed, Be of sin the double cure; Save me from its guilt and pow'r. 2. Not the labor of my hands Can fulfil Thy law's demands; Could my zeal no respite know, Could my tears forever flow, All for sin could not atone; Thou must save, and Thou alone. 3. Nothing in my hand I bring Simply to Thy cross I cling; Naked, come to Thee for dress, Helpless, look to Thee for grace; Foul, I to the Fountain fly, Wash me, Saviour, or I die. 4. While I draw this fleeting breath, When mine eyes shall close in death, When I soar to world's unknown, See Thee on Thy Judgment throne,— Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee.
