. The  Lord is my Shepherd, no want shall I know;  I feed in green pas tures, safefold  ed I rest; He lead eth my soul  where the still waters flow, Restores  me when wand'ring, redeems when oppressed. 2. Thro' the val ley and shad ow of death  tho' I stray,  Since Thou  art my Guard ian, no e  vil I fear; Thy rod  shall defend  me, Thy staff be my stay, No harm  can befall,  with my Com  forter near. 3. In the midst  of afflic tion my ta ble is spread,  With bless ings unmeas ured my cup   runneth o'er; With per fume and oil  Thou annointest my head; O, what  shall I ask  of Thy providence more? 4. Let  good ness and mer cy, my boun tiful God,  Still fol low my steps  till I meet Thee above; I seek—  by the path  which my forefathers trod, Thro' land  of their so journ— Thy kingdom of love.
