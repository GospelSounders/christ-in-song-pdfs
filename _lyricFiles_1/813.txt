. O could our thoughts  and wishes fly,  Above these gloom y shades, To those  bright worlds  beyond the sky,  Where sorrow ne'er  invades! 2. There, joys unseen  by mor tal eyes, Or reason's fee ble ray, In ev erblooming pros pect rise,  Exposed to no decay. 3. Lord, send a beam  of light  divine,  To guide our up ward aim; With one reviv ing look  of Thine, Our languid hearts inflame. 4. O then, on faith's  sublimest wing,  Our ardent souls  shall rise, To those bright scenes  where pleas ures spring  Immortal in the skies.
