. O golden  day, so long de sired, Born of  a darksome night, The waiting  earth at last is nown, fired By Thy  re splendent light. And  hark! the promised heav'nly chord Is  heard from sea to sea; This song: One  Master, Christ, the  Lord; And brethren all are we. 2. The noises  of the night shall cease,  The storms  no longer roar; The factions  foes of love and  peace Shall vex the soul no more. A  thousand thousand voices  sing The  surging harmony; One Master, Christ, one Saviour King; And breth ren all are we. 3. Sing on, ye  heralds of the morn,  Your grand  endeavor strain, Till Christian  hearts estranged and  torn, Blend in  the  glad refrain; And  all the church, with all its  pow'rs, In  loving loyalty, Shall sing: One  Master, Christ, is  ours, And breth ren all are we. 4. O golden day! the ages crown,  Aglow with heavenly love, Rare day in  prophecy's re  On to  thy  zenith move, When  earth and heav'n with one ac cord, In  fullvoiced unity, Shall sing: One Master, Christ our  Lord, And breth ren all are we.
