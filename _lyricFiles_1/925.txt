. We've no abiding cit y here; Sad truth, were this to be  our  home; But let this thought our spirits cheer, We seek a city yet to come, We seek a city yet to come. 2. We've no abiding cit y  here, We seek a city out  of  sight; Zion its name, the Lord is there, It shines with everlasting light, It shines with everlasting light. 3. O sweet abode of peace  and  love, Where pilgrims freed from toil,  are  blest! Had I the pinions of a dove, I'd fly to thee, and be at rest, I'd fly to thee, and be at rest. 4. But hush, my soul! nor dare  re pine; The time my God appoints  is  best: While here, to do His will be mine, And His to fix my time of rest, And His to fix my time of rest.
