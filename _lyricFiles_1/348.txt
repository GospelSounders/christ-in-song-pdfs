. O little town of Bethlehem, How still we  see thee lie! Above thy deep and dreamless sleep The silent  stars go by; Yet in thy dark street shineth The Everlasting Light; The hopes and fears of all the years Are  met in thee tonight. Amen. 2. For Christ is born of Ma ry; And gathered  all above, While mortals sleep, the angels keep Their watch of  wond'ring love. O morning stars, together Proclaim the holy birth! And praises sing to God the King, And  peace to men on earth. Amen. 3. How silently, how silently The wondrous  gift is giv'n! So God imparts to human hearts The blessings of His heav'n. No ear may hear His coming; But in this world of sin, Where meek souls will receive Him still, The  dear Christ enters in. Amen. 4. O holy Child of Bethlehem, Descend to  us, we pray; Cast out our sin and enter in,— Be born in  us today. We hear the Christmas angels The great glad tidings tell,— Oh, come to us, abide with us, Our  Lord Emmanel! Amen.
