. Chief of sinners tho' I be, Jesus shed His blood for me, Died that I might live on high,— Died that I might never die; As the branch is to the vine, I am His, and He is mine. 2. O the height of Jesus' love! Higher than the heav'n above, Deeper than the deepest sea, Lasting as eternity; Love that found me— wondrous tho't! — Found me when I sought Him not. 3. Chief of sinners tho' I be, Christ is all in all to me; All my wants to Him are known, All my sorrows are His own; Safe with Him from earthly strife, He sustains the hidden life.
