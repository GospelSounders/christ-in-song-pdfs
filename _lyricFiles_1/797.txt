. O Master, let me walk with  Thee In lowly paths of service  free; Tell me Thy secret,  help me  bear The  strain of toil, the fret  of  care. 2. Help me the slow of heart  to  move By some clear, winning word  of  love; Teach me the wayward  feet to  stay, And  guide them in the home ward  way. 3. Teach me Thy patience; still  with  Thee In closer, dearer, com pany, In work that keeps faith  sweet and  strong, In  trust that triumphs o ver  wrong; 4. In hope that sends a shin ing  ray Far down the future's broad'ning  way; In peace that wealth can  never  give, With  Thee, O Master, let  me  live.
