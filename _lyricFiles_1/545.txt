. Out upon an angry ocean, Without helm or oar, Millions in the wild commotion, Sink to rise no more.   2. On a flow'ry gospel mead ow, Thousands dwell at ease, Caring not that Death's dark shad ow Haunts the stormy seas.   3. How can we who once were res cued At so great a cost, Cast adrift the only Life Line, Laughing at the lost?   4. Brothers, hear your brothers call ing, "Throw the line this way;" Sisters, see your sisters sink ing, With no arm to stay.   Throw out the lifeline! Throw out the lifeline! Night is swiftly coming; Behold the setting sun!  Throw out the lifeline! Throw out the lifeline! Jesus is the lifeline; You may save one (save one).
