. Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts! Thou fount  of  life! Thou light  of men! From the best bliss that earth imparts,  We turn unfill'd  to Thee again. 2. We taste Thee, O Thou Living Bread, And long  to  feast  upon  Thee still; We drink of Thee, the Fountainhead,  And thirst our souls  from Thee to  fill. 3. Our restless spirits yearn for Thee, Where'er  our  changeful lot  is cast; Glad, when Thy gracious smile we see,  Blest, when our faith  can hold  Thee  fast. 4. O Jesus, ever with us stay; Make all  our  mo ments calm  and bright; Chase the dark night of sin away,  Shed o'er the world  Thy ho ly  light!
