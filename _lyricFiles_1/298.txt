. O bliss of the pure ones! O bliss of the free! I've plung'd in the fountain once opened for me!  O'er sin and uncleanness exulting I stand,  And point to the nailprints in His holy hands, And point to the nailprints in His holy  hands. 2. O bliss of the sav'd ones! Christ Jesus is mine! No more condemnation; no longer I pine.  In conscious salvation I sing of His grace  Who lifted upon me the smiles of His face, Who lifted upon me the smiles of His  face. 3. O bliss of the glad ones! O bliss of the pure! No wound hath the spirit that He cannot cure;  No head bow'd with sorrow but sweetly may rest,  No tears but may vanish on His loving breast, No tears but may vanish on His loving  breast. 4. O crucified Jesus! of Thee will I sing, My blessed Redeemer, my God and my King;  My soul fill'd with rapture, shall shout o'er the grave;  In Him will I triumph, the "Mighty to Save! " In Him will I triumph, the "Mighty to  Save! "
