. O  land of rest, for thee I sigh;  When will the moment come  When  I shall lay my armor by,  And dwell with Christ at home? 2. No  tranquil joys on earth I know,  No peaceful, shelt'ring dome;  This  world's a wilderness of woe,  This world is not my home. 3. When  by affliction sharply tried,  Faith tells of scenes to come,—  Those  endless joys prepared above,—  And then I sigh for home. We'll work till Jesus comes,  We'll work   till Jesus comes, We'll work till Jesus comes,  And we'll be gathered home.
