. Hark! the song of Jubilee; Loud as mighty thunders roar, Or the fullness of the sea When it breaks upon the shore: Hallelujah! 'tis the Lord! Lo, He comes on earth to reign; Hallelujah! let the word Echo round the earth and main. 2. Hallelujah! hark! the sound Rises joyful to the skies; From above, beneath, around, Wake creation's harmonies: See Jehovah's banner furl'd, Sheath'd His sword: He speaks, 'tis done; Now the kingdoms of this world Are the kingdoms of His Son. 3. He shall reign from pole to pole With supreme, unbounded sway; He shall reign, when like a scroll Yonder heav'ns have pass'd away: Then beneath His iron rod, Man's last enemy shall fall; Hallelujah! to our God, Lo, He comes to conquer all.
