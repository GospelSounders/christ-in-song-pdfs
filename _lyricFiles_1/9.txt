###“That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us” (Acts 17:27).
1. O  tender and sweet was the Father's voice, 
As He lovingly called to me,  
"Come over the line, it is only a step, 
I'm waiting, My child, for thee."

"Over the line," hear the sweet  refrain, 
Angels are chanting the heavenly strain; 
"Over the line,"— Why should I remain 
With a step between me and Jesus? 

2. "But my sins are so many, my faith so small,"— 
Lo! the answer came quick and clear,  
"Thou needest not trust in thyself  at all, 
Step over the line, I'm here."  

"Over the line," hear the sweet  refrain, 
Angels are chanting the heavenly strain; 
"Over the line,"— Why should I remain 
With a step between me and Jesus? 

3. "But my flesh is so feeble," with tears I said, 
"And the pathway I cannot see;  
I fear if I try I may sadly fail, 
And thus  dishonor Thee." 

"Over the line," hear the sweet  refrain, 
Angels are chanting the heavenly strain; 
"Over the line,"— Why should I remain 
With a step between me and Jesus? 

4. The  world is so cold I cannot go back, 
Press  forward I surely must;  
I'll lay my weak hand in His wounded palm, 
Step over the line and trust.  

"Over the line," hear the sweet  refrain, 
Angels are chanting the heavenly strain; 
"Over the line,"— I will not remain, 
I'll  cross it and go to Jesus.
