. O blessed rest, when we recline On neverfailing pow'r divine, God's mighty arms enfolding us, The arms that hold the universe! 2. Almighty strength! but stronger yet The love that cannot us forget: Unfathom'd ocean, calm and broad! Amazing mercy of our God!3. Beyond the mountain peaks that rise Above the clouds and pierce the skies, Look up! the highest wonder see,— God's love that fills eternity. 4. Who trusts His word hath clearest sight, Who trusts His pow'r hath greatest might; Who trusts His love doth never bear The heart of doubt, the brow of care. 5. Man faileth man in trouble's hour, As fails at noon the feeble flow'r. Who trusts in God, here and afar Shines on, tho' faileth sun and star. Casting all   your care upon Je  sus, Casting all   your care upon Je  sus, Casting all   your care upon Je  sus, For  He all upon Him,    All your care,     all upon Him,    All your care,     all upon Him,    careth,  He careth for you (for you).
