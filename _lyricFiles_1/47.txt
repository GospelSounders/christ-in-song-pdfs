###“For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks” (Psalm 6:5)
1. Not in the hour of death,  
Not when the pulse is low,  
Not with the failing breath,  
Not when you fear to go;  

2. Not when the frost of time  
Has changed the gold to gray;  
Come in the golden prime  
Of manhood's summer day.  

3. Not when the noon of care  
Has robbed the flow'rs of dew;  
Come in the morning fair,  
Of life's glad springtime new.  

REFRAIN.
Come to Him now, come. Come to Him now, 
Jesus can save, O come to Him now; 
Jesus will save, O come  to Him now.
