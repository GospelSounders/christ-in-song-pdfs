O . Love divine, that stooped to share Our sharp est pang, our bitterest tear! On Thee we cast each earthborn  care; We smile at pain while Thou art near. When 2. drooping pleasure turns to grief, And tremb ling  faith is changed to fear, The murm'ring wind, the quiv'ring  leaf, Shall softly tell us, "Thou art near! " On 3. Thee we fling our burd'ning woe, O Love  di vine, forever dear; Content to suffer while we  know, Living or dying, Thou art near.
