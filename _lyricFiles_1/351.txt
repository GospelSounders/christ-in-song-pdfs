.Praise the Lord, His glories  show, Saints within His courts be low, Angels round His throne a bove, All that see and share His  love, Earth to heav'n and heav'n to  earth, Tell His wonders, sing His worth; Age to age, and shore to shore,  Praise Him, praise Him evermore.   2.Praise the Lord, His mercies  trace; Praise His providence and  grace, All that He for men hath  done, All He sends us thro' His  Son. Strings and voices, hands and hearts,  In the concert bear your parts; All that breathe, your Lord adore,  Praise Him, praise Him evermore. Amen.
