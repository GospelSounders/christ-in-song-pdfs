. Look upon the golden image, Hear the king's decree, See the burning fiery furnace, And the faithful three. 2. 'Twas a heathen king's commandment Governed conscience then, Yet how bravely for Jehovah Stood those noble men! 3. So when earthly creeds of error Bid you bend the knee, Turn and read the simple story Of the faithful three. 4. God is able to deliver As in days of old, All who walk the path of duty, Fearless, firm, and bold. Stand for the right Wherever you may be, Trust in the Lord, Like the faithful three. We will follow their example, Brave and faithful three, Bowing not before the image At the world's decree.
