.Have I need of aught, O Saviour! Aught on earth but Thee? Have I any in the heavens, Any one  but Thee? 2.Tho' I have of friends so many, Love, and gold, and health; If I have not Thee, my Saviour, Hold I a ny wealth? 3.Is there heart so kind and patient With my failings all? Or a voice so true and ready, Answering  my call? 4.Not for worlds would I exchange it,— This sweet faith in Thee! Earthly treasures cannot equal All Thou art  to me. Only Thee,   only Thee,   O the wondrous love shown me! Only Thee,   only Thee,   None on earth  but Thee.
