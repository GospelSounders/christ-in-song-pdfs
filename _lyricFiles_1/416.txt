. Blest be  the tie that binds Our hearts  in Christian love! The fel lowship  of kind red minds  Is like  to that  above. 2. Before  our Fa ther's throne We pour  our ar dent pray'rs; Our fears, our hopes,  our aims  are one,  Our com forts and our cares. 3. We share  our mu tual woes, Our mu tual bur dens bear; And of ten for  each oth er flows  The sym pathiz ing tear. 4. When we  asun der part, It gives  us in ward pain; But we  shall still  be joined  in heart  And hope to meet  again.
