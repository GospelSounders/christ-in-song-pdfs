. Saviour, breathe an evening blessing, Ere repose our  spirits  seal:  Sin and want we come confessing, Thou canst save and Thou canst heal. 2. Tho' destruction walk around us, Tho' the arrows  past us  fly;  Angelguards from Thee surround us, We are safe if Thou  art nigh. 3. Tho' the night be dark and dreary, Darkness cannot  hide from  Thee;  Thou art He who, never weary, Watchest where Thy peo ple be. 4. Should swift death this night o'ertake us, And our couch become our  tomb,  May the morn of glory wake us, Clad in heav'n's eter nal bloom.
