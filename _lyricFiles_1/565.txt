. Christian, onward! Christ is coming, Wake the hour of jubilee;  Nations waiting for the message— Onwrad, Christian, victory!  Hell's proud cohorts almost vanquished, Vanquished for  eternity. 2. Hear the cry of distant nations, Hear the call  to you and me:  Come and lift the fallen sinner, Help from Satan's wrath to flee.  Christian, onward! Christ is coming, Wake the hour of  jubilee. 3. Then with strength and courage ever, Gird the gos pel armor on;  Faithfully we'll press the battle Till the victory is won.  Christain, onward! Christ is coming, Wake the hour  of  jubilee. 4. Onward, onward, ever onward, Be our watch word in the fray,  Bear the banner bravely forward, Let there be no more delay.  Christian, onward! Christ is coming, Wake the hour  of  jubilee.
