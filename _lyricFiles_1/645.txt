. God the allterrible!  King who ordainest, Great winds Thy clarions, the lightnings Thy sword; Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest, Give to us peace,  O most merciful Lord. 2. God the allmerciful!  earth hath forsaken Thy precepts holy, and slighted Thy word; Bid not Thy wrath in its ter rors awaken; Give to us peace,  O most merciful Lord. 3. God the allrighteous One!  man hath defied Thee, Yet to eternity standeth Thy word; Falsehood and wrong shall not tar ry beside Thee; Prosper the right,  O most merciful Lord. 4. So shall we render Thee  thankful devotion, For Thy deliv'rance from peril and sword, Singing in chorus from o cean to ocean, "Thine is the pow'r  and the glory, O Lord."
