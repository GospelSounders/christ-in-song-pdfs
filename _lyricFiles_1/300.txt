.Down at the cross where my Saviour died, Down where for cleansing from sin I cried, There to my heart was the blood applied. 2.I am so wondrously saved from sin, Jesus so sweetly abides within, There at the cross where He took me in. 3.O precious Fountain that saves from sin! I am so glad I have entered in, There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean. 4.Come to this Fountain so rich and sweet, Cast thy poor soul at the Saviour's feet, Plunge in today and be made complete. Glory to His name. Glory to His name,   Glory to His name.   There to my heart was the blood applied, Glory to His name.
