. There is beauty all around, When there's love at home; There is joy in ev'ry sound, When there's love at home. Peace and plenty here abide, Smiling fair on ev'ry side; 2. In the cottage there is joy, When there's love at home; Hate and envy ne'er annoy, When there's love at home. Roses blossom 'neath our feet, All the earth's a garden sweet, 3. Kindly heaven smiles above, When there's love at home; All the earth is fill'd with love, When there's love at home. Sweeter sings the brooklet by, Brighter beams the azure sky; 4. Jesus, make me wholly Thine, Then there's love at home; May Thy sacrifice be mine, Then there's love at home. Safely from all harm I'll rest, With no sinful care distress'd, Time doth softly, sweetly glide, When there's love at home. Love at home, love at home; Time doth softly, sweetly glide, When there's love at home.
