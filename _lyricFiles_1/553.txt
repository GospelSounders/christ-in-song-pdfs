. All my class! not one forgotten When before the Throne I kneel; I would share the loving burden That my Saviour's heart doth feel. 2. All my class! if one be missing In the glorious gath'ring day, How shall I account to Jesus? What shall I with weeping say? 3. Daily would I walk before them, Sinless in God's holy sight, Pleading till His Spirit draw them, Ev'ry one to life and light. Ev'ry one, blessed tho't! Not a single name forgot. One left out, His joy would dim;  Ev'ry one is dear to Him.
