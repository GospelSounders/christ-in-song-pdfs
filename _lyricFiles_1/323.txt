. When, His salva tion  bringing, To Zion Jesus came, The children all stood  singing "Hosanna" to His name. Nor did their zeal offend Him, But as He rode along, He let them still attend Him And smiled to hear their song. 2. And, since the Lord  retaineth His love for children still, Tho' now as King  He  reigneth On Zion's heav'nly hill, We'll flock around His banner, Who sits upon the throne, And cry aloud, "Hosanna To David's royal Son." 3. For, should we fail proclaiming Our great Redeemer's praise, The stones, our si lence  shaming, Would their hosannas raise. But shall we only render The tribute of our words? No; while our hearts are tender, They too shall be the Lord's.
