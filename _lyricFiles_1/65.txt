. There's life in a look at the sacred cross, Jesus has said, "Look unto Me;" Earth with its riches is only dross, Bright treasures beyond in the cross I see. 2. When first to the Saviour I raised my eyes, Sweet was the smile that fell on me; Oft as the clouds of temptation rise, A look at the cross still my strength shall be. 3. I'll look to the cross ev'ry day and hour, Trusting the promise God has given; None ever fall neath the tempter's pow'r, Who trust and obey in the strength of Heav'n.         thee,   In a look   at Calvary;   Blessed thought,   salvation free,   By a look   at Calvaat Calvary. In a look   there's life for life for thee,   In a look at  Calvary;   Blessed thought, salvation free,   By a look    at Calvary.
