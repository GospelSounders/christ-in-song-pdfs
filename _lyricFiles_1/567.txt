. 'Tis love that makes us happy, 'Tis love that smooths the way; It helps us "mind," it makes us kind To others ev'ry day. 2. This world is full of sorrow, Of sickness, death, and sin; With loving heart we'll do our part, And try some soul to win. 3. And when this life is over, And we are called above, Our song shall be eternally, Of Jesus and His love. God is love; we're His little children. God is love; we would be like Him. 'Tis love that makes us happy, 'Tis love that smooths the way; It helps us "mind," it makes us kind To others every day.
