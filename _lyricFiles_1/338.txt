.Purer yet and purer I would be in mind, Dearer yet and dearer Ev'ry duty find; Hoping still and trusting God without a fear, Patientrly believing He will make all clear. Amen. 2.Calmer yet and calmer In the hours of pain, Surer yet and sur er Peace at last to gain; Suff'ring still and do ing, To His will resigned, And to God subduing Heart and will and mind. Amen. 3.Higher yet and higher Out of clouds and night, Nearer yet and near er Rising to the light— Light serene and ho ly, Where my soul may rest, Pu fied and lowly, Sanctified and blest. Amen. 4.Swifter yet and swifter Ever onward run, Firmer yet and firm er Step as I go on; Oft these earnest long ings Swell within my breast, Yet their inner meaning Ne'er can be express'd. Amen.
