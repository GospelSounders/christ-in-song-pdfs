Now we thank  Thee for Thy bless ing On this sacred day of rest, And for truths  which Thou hast shown  us In Thy  word divinely blest. 3. Ev'ry day  and ev'ry mo ment We are safe if Thou art near; From all dan ger Thou canst re scue, In our  sorrows  Thou canst cheer. 4. We will trust  Thy constant watch care, For Thou  knowest what is best; O, forev er guide and guard  us, Till we reach our  final rest!
