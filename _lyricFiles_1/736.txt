. Long upcomes, on the mountains, weary, Have the saints, scattered flock  been torn; Dark the deemed, desert paths, and dreary; Grievous  trials have  they borne.  Now the  gath'ring call is sounding, Solemn  in its warning voice; Union,  faith, and love, abounding, Bid the  little flock re joice. 2. Now the  light of truth they're seek ing, In its onward track  pur sue; All the ten commandments keep ing, They are holy, just  and  true. On the words of life they're feed ing, Precious  to their taste, so sweet; All their  Master's precepts heed ing, Bowing humbly at His  feet. 3. Soon He   with clouds descend ing; All His   entombed, a rise; The rein anthems blend ing, Shout their vic'try thro'  the  skies. O, we  long for Thine appear ing; Come, O  Saviour, quickly come! Blessed hope! our spirits cheer ing, Take Thy ransomed chil dren  home.
