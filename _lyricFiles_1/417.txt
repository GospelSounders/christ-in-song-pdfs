. "Forbid  them not," the Sav iour cried, "But suf fer them  to come;" Ah, then  mater nal tears were dried, And un belief  was dumb. 2. Lord, we  believe,  and we  obey; We bring  them at  Thy word; Be Thou our child ren's strength  and stay, Their portion and  reward. 3. Let not earth's plea sures draw them down; Lord, give  them strength  to rise, And thro'  Thy strong,  attrac tive pow'r, At last  to gain the prize.
