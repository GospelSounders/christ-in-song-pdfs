. The  golden morning is fast approaching; Jesus soon will come To  take His faithful and happy children To their promised home. 2. The  gospel summons will soon be carried To the nations round; The  Bridegroom then will  cease to tarry And the trumpet sound. 3. Attended by all the shining angels, Down the flaming sky The  Judge will come, and will take His people Where they will not die. 4. The  lov'd of earth who have long been parted, Meet in that glad day; The  tears of those who are broken hearted Shall be wiped away. O, we see the gleams of the golden morning Piercing thro' this night of gloom! O, we see the gleams of the golden morning That will burst the tomb.
