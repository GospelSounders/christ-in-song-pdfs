. Hark! that shout  of  rapture high, Bursting forth  from  yonder cloud; Jesus comes, and  thro' the sky,  Angels tell their joy a loud,  Angels  tell their  joy aloud. 2. Hark! the trum pet's  awful voice Sounds abroad  o'er  sea and  land; Let His people  now rejoice;  Their redemption is at  hand,  Their re demption  is at hand. 3. See, the Lord  appears in view; Heav'n and earth  before Him  fly; Rise, ye saints, He  comes for you;  Rise, to meet Him in  the  sky,  Rise, to meet Him  in the sky. 4. Go and dwell with  Him above, Where no foe can  e'er mo lest; Happy in the  Saviour's love,  Ever blessing, ev er  blest,  Ever  blessing,  ever blest.
