. My spir it on  Thy care, Blest  Saviour,  I recline; Thou wilt not leave me  to despair, For Thou art love divine. 2. In Thee  I place  my trust, On  Thee I  calmly  rest; I know Thee good, I  know Thee just, And count  Thy choice the  best. 3. Whate'er  events  betide, Thy  will they  all perform; Safe in Thy breast my  head I hide, Nor fear  the coming  storm. 4. Let good or ill befall, It  must be  good for  me, Secure of having  Thee in all, Of hav ing all in  Thee.
