.Joys area  flowing like a river, Since the Comforter has come; He abides with us forever, Makes the trusting heart His home. 2.O what holy peace and glad ness! What a comfort is our Guest. No more unbelief and sad ness, As obeying now we rest. 3.Like the rain that falls from heav en, Like the sunlight from the sky, So the Holy Ghost is giv en, Coming gently from on high. 4.Lo!  fruitful field is grow ing, Blessed fruits of righteousness; And the streams of life are flow ing In the lonely wilderness. 5.What a wonderful salva tion, Where we always see His face! What a peaceful habita tion! What a quiet resting place! Blessed quietness, holy quietness, Sweet assurance in my soul; On the stormy sea, Jesus speaks tome, And the billows cease to roll.
