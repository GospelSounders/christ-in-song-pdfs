. How far from home? I asked, as on I bent my steps— the watchman spake: "The long, dark night is al most gone, The morning soon will break. Then weep no more, but speed thy flight, With Hope's bright star thy guiding ray, Till thou shalt reach the realms  of light, In everlasting day." 2. I asked the warrior on  the field; This was his soulinspiring song: "With courage, bold, the sword  I'll wield, The battle is not long. Then weep no more, but well endure The conflict, till thy work is done; For this we know, the prize  is sure, When victory is won." 3. I asked again; earth, sea,  and sun Seemed, with one voice, to make reply; "Time's wasting sands are near ly run, Eternity is nigh. Then weep no more— with warning tones, Portentous signs are thickening round, The whole creation, wait ing, groans, To hear the trumpet sound." 4. Not far from home! O bless ed thought! The traveler's lonely heart to cheer; Which oft a healing balm  has brought, And dried the mourner's tear. Then weep no more, since we shall meet Where weary footsteps never roam— Our trials past, our joys  complete, Safe in our Father's home.
