. I've reach'd the land of corn and wine, And all its riches fully mine; Here shines undim'd one blissful day, For all my night has pass'd away. 2. My Saviour comes and walks with me, And sweet communion here have we; He gently leads me by the hand, For this is heaven's border land. 3. A sweet perfume upon the breeze Is borne from eververnal trees And flow'rs that neverfading grow Where streams of life forever flow. 4. The zephyrs seem to float to me Sweet sounds to heaven's melody, As angels with the whiterob'd throng Join in the sweet redemption song. O, Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land, As on thy highest mount I stand, I look away across the sea, Where mansions are prepar'd forme,  And view the shining glory shore, My heav'n, my home forever more.
