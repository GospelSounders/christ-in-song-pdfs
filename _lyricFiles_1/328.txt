.Worthy, worthy, is the Lamb, Worthy, worthy is the Lamb; Worthy, worthy is the Lamb That   was   slain. 2.Saviour, let Thy kingdom come! Now the pow'r of sin consume; Bring Thy blest millennium, Ho  ly   Lamb. 3.Thus may we each moment feel, Love Him, serve Him, praise Him still, Till we all on Zion's hill See   the   Lamb. Glory, hallelujah! Praise Him, hallelujah! Glory, hallelujah To   the   Lamb!
