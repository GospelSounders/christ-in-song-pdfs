. Come, O my soul, in sacred lays Attempt  thy great  Creator's praise; But O what tongue can speak His fame! What mortal verse   declare His name! 2. Enthroned amid the radiant spheres, He glo ry like a gar  ment wears; To form a robe of light divine, Ten thou sand suns around Him shine. 3. Raised on devotion's lofty wing, Do thou,  my soul,  His glo  ries sing; And let His praise employ thy tongue Till list'n ing worlds shall join the song.
