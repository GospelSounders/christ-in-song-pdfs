. I will follow Thee, my Saviour, Wheresoe'er my lot may be; Where Thou go est I will follow; Yes, my Lord, I'll follow Thee. 2. Tho' the road be rough and thorny, Trackless as the foaming sea, Thou hast trod  this way before me, And I'll gladly follow Thee. 3. Tho' I meet with tribulations, Sorely tempted tho' I be; I remem ber Thou wast tempted, And rejoice to follow Thee. 4. Though Thou lead'st me thro' affliction, Poor, forsaken, though I be; Thou wast de stitute, afflicted, And I only follow Thee. 5. Though to Jordan's rolling billows, Cold and deep, Thou leadest me, Thou hast crossed the waves before me, And I still will follow Thee. I will follow Thee, my Saviour, Thou didst shed Thy blood for me; And tho' all  men should forsake Thee, By Thy grace I'll follow Thee.
