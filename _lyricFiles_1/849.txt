. When my lifework is ended, and I cross the swelling tide, When "this mortal puts on immortality;" I shall know my Redeemer when I reach the other side, And His smile will be the first to welcome me. 2. O, the soulthrilling rapture when I view His blessed face, And the luster of His kindly beaming eye; How my full heart will praise Him for the mercy, love and grace, That prepares for me a mansion in the sky. 3. O, the dear ones departed! How the tender mem'ries come, As the farewell at the river I recall; In the sweet vales of Eden we shall meet no more to roam, But I long to see my Saviour first of all. 4. Thro' the gates to the city, in a robe of spotless white, He will lead me where no tears shall ever fall; In the glad song of ages I shall mingle with delight; But I long to meet my Saviour first of all. I shall know  Him, I shall know Him, And redeemed by His side I shall stand, I shall know    Him, I shall know Him By the print of the nails  in His hands.
