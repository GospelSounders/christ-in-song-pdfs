. Come, ye disconsolate, wher e'er ye languish; Come to the mercyseat, fervently kneel; Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your  anquish; Earth  has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal. 2. Joy of the comfortless, light  of the stray ing, Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure; Here speaks the Comforter, tender ly  say ing, "Earth  has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure." 3. Here see the Bread of Life, see  waters flow ing Forth from the throne of God, pure from above; Come to the feast of love, come ev er  know ing Earth  has no sorrow but heaven can remove.
