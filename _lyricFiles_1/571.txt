. Master, hast Thou work for me? I would gladly toil for Thee; I have neither strength nor skill, Yet some place I long to fill; Tho' my hands are small and weak, Yet some little task I seek. 2. Let me learn in early youth, Lessons from Thy Book of truth; Let me seek to walk Thy ways, Know Thy will and sing Thy praise; Heart and hands to Thee I bring, Let me serve Thee, holy King! 3. Let me daily sow some seed, Daily do some kindly deed; Grant Thy loving help to me, Give me perfect trust in Thee; Trusting Thee to teach me how, Let me serve Thee, here and now. Master hast Thou work for me? I would gladly toil for Thee.
