. Speed Thy servants, Saviour, speed them; Thou art  Lord of winds and waves: They were bound, but Thou hast freed them; Now they  go to free the slaves: Be Thou with them, be Thou with them; 'Tis Thine arm alone that saves. 2. Friends and home and all forsaking, Lord, they  go at Thy command, As their stay Thy promise taking, While they  traverse sea and land; O, be with them, O, be with them; Lead them safely by the hand. 3. When no fruit appears to cheer them, And they  seem to toil in vain, Then in mercy, Lord, draw near them, Then their  sinking hopes sustain; Thus supported, thus supported, Bid their zeal revive again. 4. In the midst of opposition May they  trust, O Lord, in Thee; When success attends their mission, May Thy  servants humble be: Never leave them, never leave them, Till Thy face in heav'n they see.
