. It came upon  the midnight clear, That glo rious song of old,  From angels bending near the earth To touch their harps  of gold;  "Peace on the earth,  goodwill to men, From heav'n's allgra cious King."  The world in solemn stillness lay, To hear the angels sing.  2. Still thro' the op en skies they come, With peace ful wing  unfurled;  And still their heav'n ly music floats O'er all the wea ry world:  Above its sad and lovely plains They bend on hov'r ing wing,  And ever o'er  its Babel sounds The blessed an gels sing.  3. But with the woes  of sin and strife The world  has suffered long;  Beneath the an gelstrain have rolled Two thousand years  of wrong;  And man, at war  with man, hears not The love song which  they bring:  O cease, ye mor tals, cease your strife, And hear the an gels sing!
