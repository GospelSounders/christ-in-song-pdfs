. Hear the pennies dropping! Listen while they fall; Ev'ry one for Jesus— He will get them all. 2. Dropping, dropping ever, From each little hand; 'Tis our gift to Jesus, From His little band. 3. Now, while we are little, Pennies are our store; But, when we are older, Lord, we'll give Thee more. 4. Tho' we've little money, We can give Him love; He will own our off'ring, Smiling from above. Dropping, dropping, dropping, dropping; Hear the pennies fall! Ev'ry one for Jesus— He will get them all.
