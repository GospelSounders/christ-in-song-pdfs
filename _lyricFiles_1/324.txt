. Come, praise your  Lord and Saviour, In strains  of holy mirth; Give thanks to  Him, O children, Who lived  a  child on earth. He  loved the little chil  dren And  call'd them to His side, His loving  arms embraced them, And for  their  sake He died. 2. Let boyhood  loudly praise  Thee With songs  of holy joy, For Thou on  earth didst so journ, A pure  and  spotless boy. Make  us like Thee obedient,  Like  Thee from evil free; Like Thee in  God's own tem ple; In hap py  home like Thee. 3. Let girlhood sweetly praise  Thee, The low ly maiden's Son; In Thee all  gentlest grac es Are gath ered into one. O  give that best adorn  ment Which  Christian maid can wear,— The meek and  quiet spir rit, Which shone  in  Thee so fair. 4. To Thee, with voices blend ed, We sing  our songs of praise: Be Thou the light and pat tern Of all  our childhood days; And  lead us ever on ward,  That,  while we stay below, We may like Thee, O Je sus, In grace  and  wisdom grow.
