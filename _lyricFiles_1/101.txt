. I  hear Thy welcome voice, That calls me, Lord, to Thee; For cleansing in Thy precious blood, That flow'd on Calvary. 2. Tho'  coming weak and vile, Thou dost my strength assure; Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse, Till spotless all, and pure. 3. 'Tis  Jesus calls me on To perfect faith and love, To perfect hope, and peace, and trust, For earth and heav'n above. 4. All  hail, atoning blood! All hail, redeeming grace! All hail! the gift of Christ, our Lord, Our Strength and Righteousness. I am coming, Lord! Coming now to Thee! Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood That flow'd on Calvary.
