. The wonders of redeeming love Our highest thoughts exceed; The Son of God comes  from above, The Son of God comes from above For sinful man to bleed. 2. He gives Himself, His life, His all, A sinless sacrifice, For man He drains the  cup of gall, For man He drains the cup of gall, For man the Maker dies. 3. And now before His Father's face His precious blood He pleads; For those who seek the  throne of grace, For those who seek the throne of grace, His love still intercedes.
