. Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide; The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide! When other helpers fail, and comforts flee, Help of the helpless, O, abide with me! 2. Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day; Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away; Change and decay in all around I see; O Thou who changest not, abide with me! 3. Not a brief glance I ask, nor passing word, But as Thou dwell'st with Thy disciples, Lord, Familiar, condescending, patient, free, Come, not to sojourn, but abide with me! 4. I need Thy presence ev'ry passing hour; What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r: Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be? Thro' cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me! 5. I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless; Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness; Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory? I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.
