. O  safe to the Rock that is high er than I, My have soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly; So  sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine would I be; Thou I blest "Rock of Ages," I'm hiding in Thee. 2. In the clam of the noontide, in sor row's lone hour, In  times when temptation casts o'er me its power; In the tempests of life, on its wide,  heaving sea; Thou  blest "Rock of Ages," I'm hiding in Thee. 3. How  oft in the conflict, when press'd  by the foe, I  fled to my Refuge and breath'd out my woe; How  often, when trials like seabillows roll, Have  hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul. Hiding in Thee, Hiding in Thee, Thou blest "Rock of Ages," I'm hiding in Thee.
