. God of light and match less splendor, Feeble tho' the praise  we bring, Let Thy Spirit touch   and  tender Ev'ry heart as now we sing. 2. Heav'n above cannot  contain Thee; At Thy presence earth  would flee; And tho' ev'ry sin   doth  pain Thee; Still Thy mercy spareth me! 3. Grateful praise my tongue shall offer, 'Neath Thy smile or 'neath  Thy rod; Take the humble gift   I  proffer,— Heart, and mind, and strength, O God!
