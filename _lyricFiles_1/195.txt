. Would we be joyful in the Lord? Then count the riches o'er,  Revealed to faith within His Word, And note the boundless store. 2. For ev'ry sin, by grace divine A pardon free bestowed; And with the pardon peace is mine, The peace in Jesus' blood. 3. Of grace to break the pow'r of sin, He gives a full supply;  The Holy Ghost, the heart within, From sin doth purify. 4. The pow'r to win a soul to God, The Spirit, too, imparts;  And He, the gift of Christ, our Lord, Dwells now in all our hearts. 5. These blessings we by faith receive, By simple childlike trust:  In Christ 'tis God's delight to give; He promised, and He must. There is par don, peace and pow'r,  And purity, and Paradise; With all of these  in Christ for me,  Let Par don, peaceand pow'r,    par don, peaceand pow'r,    And puri ty,and Para dise;With all of these    in Christ for me,  joyful songs of praise to Him arise.
