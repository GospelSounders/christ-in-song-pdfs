. Father, I stretch my hands to Thee; No other help I know; If  Thou withdraw Thyself from me, Ah,  wither shall I  go? 2. On Thy dear Son I now believe, O let me feel Thy pow'r; And  all my varied  wants relieve, In  this accepted  hour. 3. Author of faith! to Thee I lift My weary, longing eyes: O  let me now receive that gift; My  soul without it  dies. I do believe, I now believe That Jesus died for me, And  that He shed His  precious blood From  sin to set me  free.
