. The dove of peace sings in my heart, "In strife and war thou hast no part; Thy place among the hosts of wrong Is but to echo love's sweet song." 2. The dove of peace hath radiant wings, And light and melody He brings; He tells of my sooncoming King, Of praises that the angels sing. 3. O gentle voice of Jesus' love! It links the life to heav'n above, And thro' all sorrow and all wrong O'erflows the soul with tender song. 4. The dove of peace shall ne'er depart, But keep His home within my heart. E'en when I rise to worlds above, I'll hear the singing of the dove. 5. O wouldst thou hear the dove within? Let Jesus cleanse thy heart from sin: Then in sweet measures from above Thou'lt hear the music of His love. The dove of peace  sings in my soul,  "Thy Saviour's blood  doth make thee whole;"  The Spirit's voice,  like wooing dove,  Sings of my Saviour's deathless love.
