. Shepherd divine, Thou leadest me Where the still waters  gently flow; In pastures fair Thou feed  est  me: I  trust Thy love, no want  I know. 2. In danger's hour Thou hidest me, Safe from the foe of  Thy dear flock; At sultry noon Thou guid  est  me To  rest beside the cool ing rock. 3. When chilling dews of evening fall, Then to the fold Thou  bidst me come; Gladly I hasten at   Thy  call; Sweet  is the voice that calls  me home.
