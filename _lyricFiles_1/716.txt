. How long, O Lord our Saviour, Wilt Thou remain away? Our hearts are growing weary Of Thy so long delay. O when shall come the moment, When, brighter far than morn,  The sunshine of Thy glory Shall on Thy people dawn? 2. How long O gracious Master, Wilt Thou Thy household leave? So long hast Thou now tarried, Few Thy return believe. Immersed in sloth and folly, Thy servants, Lord, we see;  And few of us stand ready With joy to welcome Thee. 3. O, wake Thy slumb'ring people; Send forth the solemn cry; Let all the saints repeat it,— "The Saviour draweth nigh! " May all our lamps be burning, Our loins well girded be,  Each longing heart preparing With joy Thy face to see.
