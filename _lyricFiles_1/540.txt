. Walk in the light the Lord has given To guide thy steps aright;  His Holy Spirit, sent from heav'n,  Can cheer the darkest night. 2. Walk in the light of gospel truth  That shines from God's own Word,  A light to guide in early youth  The faithful of the Lord. 3. Walk in the light; tho' shadows dark  Should fall across thy way,  Darkness will flee before the light  Of God's eternal day. 4. Walk in the light, and thou shall know  The love of God to thee; The fellowship, so sweet below,  In heav'n will sweeter be. Walk  in the light,  Walk  in the light  Walk  in the light;  Walk in the light, in the beau ti fullight of God, Walk in the light, in the beau ti fullight of God, Walk in the light, in the beau ti-fullight of God. Walk in the light, the light of God.
