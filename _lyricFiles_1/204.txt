. Christ has for sin atonement made, What a wonderful Saviour! We are redeemed! the price is paid! 2. I praise Him for the cleansing blood, What a wonderful Saviour! That reconciled my soul to God; 3. He cleansed my heart from all its sin, What a wonderful Saviour! And now He reigns and rules therein; 4. He walks beside me all the way, What a wonderful Saviour! And keeps me faithful day by day; 5. He gives me overcoming pow'r, What a wonderful Saviour! And triumph in each trying hour; 6. To Him I've given all my heart, What a wonderful Saviour! The world shall never share a part; What a wonderful Saviour! What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Jesus! What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord!
