##YET THERE IS ROOM
##Horatius Bonar

###Luke 14:22
1. "Yet there is room!" The Lamb's bright hall of song, 
With its fair glory, beckons thee along; 

2. Daylight declines, The sun is sinking low; 
The shadows lengthen, light makes haste to go: 

3. The bridal hall is filling for the feast: 
Pass in! pass in! and be the Bridegroom's guest: 

4. It fills, it fills, that hall of jubilee! 
Make haste, make haste; 'tis not too full for thee: 

5. Yet there is room! Still open stands the gate, 
The gate of love; it is not yet too late: 

6. Pass in, pass in! That banquet is for thee; 
That cup of everlasting love is free: 

7. All heaven is there, all joy! Go in, go in; 
The angels beckon thee the prize to win: 

8. Soon night will close that gate and seal thy doom: 
Then the sad cry, "No room for me, no room! " 

CHORUS.
Room, room, yet there is room; 
Come, come, come while there's room.
