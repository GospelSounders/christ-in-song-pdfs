. Are you tenting on the lowlands Of the fated, flow'ry plain?  Are you nearing life's high mountains, As the night comes on again? 2. Does fair Sodom in her glory Beckon you with ease or gain?  Heed her awful judgment story; Linger not, her joys are vain. 3. To the mountains of salvation! Hear the angel, Mercy, call;  Do not tarry! look not backward! Hasten on ere vengeance fall. Keep tenting toward the highlands,   Each evening nearer home;  Keep tenting  toward the highlands,   Keep tenting nearer home.      Keep tenting toward the highlands of life,  evening nearer sweet home;    Keep tent-ing toward the highlands of life,  tenting nearer  heav'nly home.
