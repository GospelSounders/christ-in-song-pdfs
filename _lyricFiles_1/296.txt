.Walking with Thee, my God, Saviour benign, Daily confer on me  Converse divine; Jesus, in Thee restored, Brother, and blessed Lord, Let it be mine,  Let it be mine. 2.Walking with Thee, my God, Like as a child Leans on his father's strength,  Crossing the wild. And by the way is taught Lessons of holy thought, Faith undefiled,  Faith undefiled. 3.Walking with Thee, my God, Humbly with Thee; Yet from all care and fear  Lovingly free. E'en as a friend with friend, Cheer'd to the journey's end, Walking with Thee,  Walking with Thee.
