##FATHER, WE COME TO THEE
##“...Behold, we come unto thee: for thou art the Lord our God” (Jeremiah 3:22).
. Father, we come to Thee, 
No other help have we, Thou wilt our refuge be, 
On Thee we call; Earth is but dark and drear 
Without Thy presence near; 
Be Thou our comfort here, 
Father of all. 
2. Save from our many foes, 
Save from our earthly woes, Be Thou our soul's repose 
In time of need; Fearful are we and weak, 
To us sweet courage speak; 
Thy mighty arm we seek 
For strength indeed. 
3. Give us Thy grace divine, 
Seal us forever 
Thine, Our wayward feet incline 
From sin to flee. O guide us we implore, 
'Till weary life is o'er, 
And on a brighter shore 
We dwell with Thee. 
Father, we come to Thee, 
Turn not away; Helpless we come to 
Thee, Hear while we pray.
