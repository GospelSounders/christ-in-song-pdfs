##PREACH MY GOSPEL
##(Truro. L. M.)
. "Go, preach My Gospel," saith the Lord, "Bid the whole earth  
My  grace receive; 
He shall be saved who trusts  My  word, And they condemned  who  disbelieve. 
2. "I'll make your great commission known, And ye shall prove  
My  Gospel true 
By all the works that 
I  have  done, By all the won ders  ye shall do. 
3. "Teach all the nations 
My commands; I'm with you till  the  world shall end; 
All pow'r is vested to  My  hands; I can destroy,  and  
I defend."
