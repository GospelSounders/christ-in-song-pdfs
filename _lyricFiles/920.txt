##OUR FINAL REST
##(Hakes, 9s  7s.)
. There is sweet rest for feet now weary, 
In the rugged, upward way; 
There is a morn when midnight dreary Shall  be lost in perfect day. 
2. For that blest morn our hearts  are longing, 
When shall end earth's night of woe; 
When, thro' those pearly por tals thronging, Mor tal cares we leave below. 
3. Soon to that city, bright,  eternal, 
Weary pilgrims all shall go; 
Soon we shall rest in past ures vernal, Where  life's waters ceaseless flow. 
4. Father above, in mercy guide us 
To those mansions of the blest; 
Safe in the Rock of 
A ges hide us Till  we gain our final rest.
