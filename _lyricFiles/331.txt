##HOW CAN I KEEP FROM SINGING?
##(Materna. 8s  7s. D.)
. My life flows on in endless song; 
AI mid earth's lamentation,  
I hear the sweet, tho' faroff hymn 
That hails a new creation; 
Thro' all the tumult and the strife 
I hear the music ringing; 
It finds an echo in my soul, How can I keep from singing? 
2. What tho' my joys and comforts die, 
The Lord my Helper liveth!  
What tho' the darkness gather round: 
Songs in the night He giv eth! 
No storm can shake my inmost calm 
While to that refuge clinging; 
Since God is Lord of heav'n and earth, How can I keep from singing? 
3. I lift mine eyes; the cloud grows thin;  see the blue above it;  
And day by day this pathway smooths 
Since first I learned to love  it. 
The peace of God makes fresh my heart, 
A fountain ever springing; 
All things are mine, since 
I am Hisâ€” How can I keep from singing?
