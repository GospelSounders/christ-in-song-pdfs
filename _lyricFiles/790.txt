##ONE LIVING FAITH
##(Old Hundred. L. M.)
. God's law demands one living faith, 
And not a crowd of lifeless creeds; 
Its warrant is a firm "God saith;" Its claim not words, but  living deeds. 
2. O Lord, forgiveâ€” Thy holy law 
Grows tarnish'd in our earthly clasp; 
Pure in itself, without a flaw It dims in our too  worldly grasp. 
3. Forgive the  sacrilege, and take 
From ev'ry soul th' unholy stain, 
And help us for Thy 
Son's dear sake, To keep 
Thy perfect  law again.
