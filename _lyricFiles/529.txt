##PILLAR OF FIRE
##“The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them” (Psalm 34:7).
. The angel of the Lord encampeth 
Round about us, round about us; Round about the souls that fear 
Him, Night and day. 
2. When danger hovers o'er our pathway, 
He will hide us, He will hide us, Safe within the mighty shadow Of His wing. 
3. We'll trust Thee as we onward journey, 
God of Israel, God of 
Israel, Till we reach the land of promise, Just before. O pillar of fire,  pillar of cloud;  O fie ry,cloudy pillar, fie ry,cloudy pillar, 
Lead me, lead me ev'ry day! 
O pillar of fire,  pillar of cloud,   
O fie ry,cloudy pillar, fie ry,cloudy pillar, 
Lead me on my heav'nly way.
