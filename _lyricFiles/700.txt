##PRAY FOR REAPERS
##(Regent Square. 8s  7s. 6L.)
. Saints of God, the dawn is bright'ning, Token of our coming Lord; O'er the earth the field is whit'ning. 
Louder rings the  Master's word: 
Pray for reapers, Pray for reapers, 
In the sheaves harvest  of the  Lord. 
2. Feebly now they toil in sadness, Weeping o'er the waste around, Slowly gath'ring grains of gladness, 
While their echoing  cries resound: 
Pray that reapers, Pray that reapers, 
In God's harvest  may abound.  
3. Now, O Lord, fulfill 
Thy pleasure, Breathe upon 
Thy chosen band, And, with pentecostal measure, 
Send forth reapers  in our land; 
Faithful reapers, Faithful reapers, 
Gath'ring   for  
Thy right  hand. 
4. Soon shall end the time of weeping, Soon the reaping time will come, Heav'n and earth together keeping 
God's eternal  harvest home; 
Saints and angels, Saints and angels, 
Shout the world's  great  harvest  home.
