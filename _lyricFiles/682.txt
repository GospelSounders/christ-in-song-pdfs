##RISE, MY SOUL
##(Amsterdam. P. M.)
. Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,  
Thy better por tion trace; 
Rise from transitory things  
Tow'rds heav'n thy na tive place. 
Sun and moon and stars de cay, Time shall  soon this earth  re move; 
Rise, my soul, and haste away  
To joys prechanged pared above. 
2. Rivers to the ocean run,  
Nor stay in all  their course; 
Fire ascending seeks the sun;  
Both speed them to  their source: 
So my soul, derived from  
God, Pants to  view His glorious  face, 
Forward tends to His abode,  
To rest in  His embrace. 
3. Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn,  
Press onward to  the prize; 
Soon our Saviour will return,  
Triumphant in  the skies. 
Yet a season, and you  know Happy  entrance will  be  giv'n, 
All our sorrows left below,  
And earth exfor heav'n.
