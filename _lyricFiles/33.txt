###“...The fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is” (1 Corinthians 3:13).
1. We are building in sorrow or joy A temple the world may not see, 
Which  time cannot mar nor destroy: We  build for eter nity.  

2. Ev'ry tho't that we've ever had, Its  own little place  has fill'd; 
Ev'ry deed we have done, good or bad, Is a stone in the temple we build.  

3. Ev'ry word that so lightly falls, Give some  heart joy  or pain, 
Will  shine in our temple wall, Or  ever its beauty stain.  

4. Are you building for God  alone? Are you building in faith  and love, 
A  temple the Father will own, In the city of light  above?  

CHORUS.
We are building, ev'ry day (We are building, building ev'ry  day).   
A temple the world may not see;  
Building, building ev'ry day, Building for eternity!
