##THE LOVE OF JESUS
##W. E. Littlewood
##T. E. Perkins
1. There is no love like the love of Jesus, Never to fail or fall, 
Till into the fold of the peace of God, He has gathered us all. 

2. There is no heart like the heart of Jesus, Fill'd with a tender love; 
No throb of  woe that our heart can know, But He feels it above. 

3. Oh, hearken now to the voice of Jesus; Why will you longer roam? 
There's peace and  rest on His loving breast, And a glad heav'nly home. 

CHORUS.
Jesus' love, precious love, Boundless and pure and free! 
Oh, turn to that love, weary, wand'ring soul, Jesus pleadeth for thee.
