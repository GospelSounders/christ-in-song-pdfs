##LORD OF ALL BEING
##(Park Street. L. M.)
.Lord of all be ing, throned  afar, 
Thy glory flames from sun  and  star, Center and soul of ev'ry sphere, Yet to each loving heart how near! Yet to each lov ing heart how near! 
2.Sun of our life,  Thy quick'ning ray 
Sheds on our path the glow  of  day; Star of our hope, 
Thy softened light Cheers the long watches of  the night. Cheers the long watch es of  the night. 
3.Our midnight is  Thy smile  withdrawn, 
Our noontide is Thy gra cious  dawn, Our rainbow arch 
Thy mercy's sign, All, save the clouds of sin,  are 
Thine. All, save the clouds  of sin,  are 
Thine. 
4.Lord of all life,  below, above, 
Whose light is truth, whose warmth  is  love, Before Thy everblazing throne We ask no luster of  our own. We ask no lus ter of  our own. 
5.Grant us Thy truth to make us free, 
And kindling hearts that burn  for  
Thee, Till all Thy living altars claim One holy light, one heav'n ly flame! One holy light,  one heav'n ly flame.
