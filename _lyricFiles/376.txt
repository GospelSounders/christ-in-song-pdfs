##POWER TO OBEY
##(Spanish Hymn. 7s. 6L.)
.Grant Thy blessing, now, 
O Lord, While we look into 
Thy word: To our hearts 
Thy truth reveal; Fill us with a holy zeal; 
As we learn Thy righteous way, 
Give us power to obey. 
2.Sanctify us, Lord, we pray, By the lessons of this day: May our souls by Thee be fed, And to living fountains led; 
In a world of care and sin, 
Keep us ever pure within.
