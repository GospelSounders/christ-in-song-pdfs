##MY NEED, AND THY LOVE
##(Flemming. 8s  6s.)
. O Father, I have naught  to  plead  
In earth beneath  or heav'n above,  
But just my own  exceeding  need,   And Thy exceeding love. 
2. The need will soon be past  and  gone,  
Exceeding great,  but quickly  o'er;  
Thy love unbought is all 
Thine  own,   And lasts forevermore.
