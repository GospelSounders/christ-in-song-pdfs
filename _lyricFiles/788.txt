##BE ON THY GUARD
##(Laban. S. M.)
. My  soul, be on thy guard! 
Ten thousand foes arise; 
The  hosts of sin are pressing  hard 
To draw thee from the skies. 
2. O  watch, and fight, and pray! 
The battle ne'er give o'er; 
Renew it boldly ev'ry  day, 
And help divine implore. 
3. Ne'er  think the vict'ry won, 
Nor lay thine armor down; 
The  arduous task will not be  done 
Till thou obtain the crown.
