###“...But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him” (Luke 15:20).
1. I've wandered far away from God, 
Now I'm coming home; 
The paths of sin too long I've trod, 
Lord, I'm coming home. 

2. I've wasted many pre cious years 
Now I'm coming home; 
I now repent with bitter tears; 
Lord, I'm coming home. 

3. I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord, 
Now I'm coming home; 
I'll trust Thy love, believe Thy word; 
Lord, I'm coming home. 

4. My only hope, my only plea, 
Now I'm coming home; 
That Jesus died, and died for me; 
Lord, I'm coming home. 

5. I need His cleansing blood I know, 
Now I'm coming home; 
O wash me whiter than the snow; 
Lord, I'm coming home. 

CHORUS.
Coming home, coming home 
Nevermore to roam; 
Open wide Thine arms of love; 
Lord, I'm coming home.
