##THE ROCK THAT IS HIGHER
##E. Johnson
. O  sometimes the shadows are deep, 
And rough seems the path to the goal; 
And sorrows, how often they sweep 
Like tempests down over the soul! 
2. O  sometimes how long seems the day, 
And sometimes how heavy my feet; 
But toiling in life's  dusty way, 
The Rock's blessed shadow, how sweet! 
3. O  near to the Rock let me keep, 
Or blessings or sorrows prevail; 
Or climbing the mountain way steep, 
Or walking the shadowy vale. 
O, then to the Rock let me fly,    
To the Rock that ishig er than 
I;    O,  then to the 
Rock let me fly,    
To the Rock that is higher than 
I.
