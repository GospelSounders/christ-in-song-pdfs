##ENTIRE CONSECRATION
##F. R. Havergal, Chorus by W. J. K.
.Take my life, and let it be ConItsecrated, 
Lord, to Thee; Take my hands and let them move At the impulse of Thy love. 
2.Take my feet, and let them be Swift and beautiful for Thee; Take my voice and let me sing Always, only, for my King. 
3.Take my lips, and let them be Filled with messages for Thee; Take my silver and my gold,— Not a mite would I withhold. 
4.Take my moments, and my days, Let them flow in endless praise; Take my intellect, and use, Ev'ry pow'r as Thou shalt choose. 
5.Take my will, and make it Thine:  shall be no longer mine! Take my heart,— it is Thine own,— It shall be 
Thy royal throne. 
6.Take my love, my Lord, 
I pour At Thy feet its treasurestore; Take myself, and 
I will be Ever, only, all for Thee. 
Wash me in the Saviour's precious blood (the precious blood), 
Cleanse me in its purifying flood (the healing flood). 
Lord, I give to Thee, my life and all, to be, 
Thine, henceforth eternally.
