##THE VOICE WITHIN
.There  lives a voice within me, 
Guest  angel  of my heart, 
Whose  whisp'rings strive to win me 
To  act a  noble part. Up evermore it springeth 
Like  some sweet praise melody, And evermore it  singeth 
This  song of songs  to me: 
2.The  leaftongues of the forest, 
The  flow'rlips  of the sod, 
The  birds that hymn their raptures 
Up  to the throne  of 
God; The summer wind that bringeth 
Joy  over land and sea, Have each a  voice that  singeth 
This  song of songs  to me: 
3.O  voice of God most tender, 
O  voice of  God divine, 
Still  be my heart's defender 
Till  ev'ry tho't is 
Thine; My soul in gladness bringeth 
Its  songs of   to 
Thee, While all a round me  singeth 
This  song of songs  to me: 
This world is full of beauty, 
That  points the  soul above, 
And if we  did our  duty, It  might be  full of love.
