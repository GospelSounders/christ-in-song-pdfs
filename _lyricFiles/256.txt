##OUR KING
##“...Another king, one Jesus” (Acts 17:7).
. Our sweetest songs of gladness, On this *delight ful day,  We bring to praise the Saviour, Who is the Life,  the Way.  
2. He lov'd the little children, When He was here  below,  And tho' He's up in heaven, He loves us yet  we know.  
3. We love to sing His praises, And hear the stories told,  Of Him when 
He was dwelling In 
Galilee  of old.  
4. O Saviour, blessed 
Saviour, We kneel before  
Thy throne,  And ask that 
Thou wilt help us To live for Thee  alone.  
We sing,   we sing,   
The praises of  our King,   We  We sing,   we sing  praises of  our Heav'nly 
King,  sing,   we sing   The glory of  our 
King.
