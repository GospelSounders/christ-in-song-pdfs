##MY REDEEMER LIVES
##(Bradford. C. M.)
. I know that  my Redeem er lives, And ever  prays  for me; 
A token  of His  love 
He gives, A pledge of liberty. 
2. Joyful in  hope, my  spir it soars To meet  Thee  from  above; 
Thy goodness  thankfully  adores, And tastes Thy precious love. 
3. When God is  Mine and  
I  am His, Of par adise possessed, 
I taste unutterble bliss, And everlast ing rest.
