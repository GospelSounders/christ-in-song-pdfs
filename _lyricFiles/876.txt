##WHEN I SHALL AWAKE
##“...I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness” (Psalm 17:15).
. When I shall awake in that fair morn of morns, After whose dawning never night returns, And with whose bright glory  day eternal burns, 
2. And when I shall see 
His glory face to face, Hear His glad welcome, feel 
His fond embrace, And feast on the fulness of 
His heav'nly grace, 
3. And when I shall meet the friends that I have loved, Clasp to my bosom dear ones long removed, And witness how faithful Christ to me hath proved, 
4. O soon I shall gaze upon the face of 
Him, Pierced to redeem me from the curse of sin, And praise 
Him forever with the glad new hymn; 
I shall be satisfied then. 
I shall be satisfied then, 
I shall be satisfied then. 
When I shall awake, in that fair morn of morns, 
I stall be satisfied then.
