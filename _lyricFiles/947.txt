##MY REST IS IN HEAVEN
##H. F. Lyte
. My  rest is in heaven, my rest is not here; 
Then  why should I tremble when trials are near? 
Be hush'd, my sad spirit, the worst that can come 
But short ens my jour ney, and hastens me home. 
2. It  is not for me to be seek ing my bliss, 
Nor  building my hopes  in a region like this; 
I look for a city that hands have not piled, 
I pant  for a coun try by sin undefiled. 
3. Let  doubt, then, and danger, my pro gress oppose, 
They  only make heav en more sweet at its close; 
Come joy, or come sorrow, whate'er may befall, 
An hour  with my God  will make up for them all.
