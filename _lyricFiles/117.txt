##COMFORT TO THE DREARY
##(Aurelia. 7s  6s. D.)
. O, Comfort to the dreary! 
O, Joy to the oppressed! 
"Come unto Me, ye weary, 
And I will give you rest." 
O, come with all your weakness, 
Come with your load of woe; 
And learn of Him with meekness 
All righteousness to know. 
2. Enslav'd of Romish error, 
Worn out with fruitless pains, 
Why live in doubt and terror? 
Come, cast away your chains! 
Renounce the superstition 
By all the world preferr'd; 
And turn from vain tradition 
To His redeeming word. 
3. Ye who the world have courted, 
And suffer'd from its spite; 
Ye who with sin have sported, 
And felt its serpentbite; 
Come, learn, your follies quitting, 
That this world's gain is loss; 
To Christ's light yoke submitting, 
Come, and take up the cross. 
4. O come and make the trial; 
Christ's service is release; 
If hard the selfdenial, 
Its fruit is joy and peace. 
His word your faith defending, 
Shall nerve you for the strife; 
Peace all your steps attending; 
The prize,â€” eternal life!
