##COME TO ME
##(Ward. L. M.)
. With tearful eyes I look around; 
Life seems a dark  and stormy  sea, 
Yet, mid the gloom, I hear a sound, 
A heav'nly whisper, 
"Come to  Me." 
2. It tells me of a place of rest; 
It tells me where  my soul may  flee: 
O, to the weary, faint, oppressed, 
How sweet the bid ding, 
"Come to  Me." 
3. "Come, for all else must fail and die! 
Earth is no rest ingplace for  thee; 
To heav'n direct thy weeping eye, 
I am thy por tion; come to  Me." 
4. O voice of mercy! voice of love! 
In conflict, grief and agony, 
Support me, cheer me from above! 
And gently whis per, 
"Come to  Me."
