##HE LOVES ME, TOO
##“Fear ye not, therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows” (Matthew 10:31).
. God sees the little sparrow fall, 
It meets His tender view; 
If God so loves the little birds, 
I know He loves me, too. 
2. He paints the lily of the field, 
Perfumes each lily bell; 
If He so loves the little flow'rs, 
I know He loves me well. 
3. God made the little birds and flow'rs, 
And all things large and small; 
He'll not forget His little ones, 
I know He loves them all. 
He loves me, too, He loves me, too, 
I know He loves me, too; 
Because He loves the little things, 
I know He loves me, too.
