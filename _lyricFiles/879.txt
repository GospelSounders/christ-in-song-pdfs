##SWEET BY AND BY
##“And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick:
. There's a land that is fairer than day, And by faith we can see it afar; 
For our Father waits over the way, To prepare us a dwelling place there. 
2. We shall sing on that beautiful shore, The melodious songs of the blest; 
And our spirits shall sorrow no more,— Not a sigh for the blessing of rest. 
3. To our bountiful 
Father above We will offer a tribute of praise, 
For the glorious gift of 
His love, And the blessings that hallow our days.      by, 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore, 
In the sweet by and by, 
We shall 
In the sweet by and by and by,  meet on that beautiful by and by,  by and by,  by and by,  meet on that beautiful shore.
