###“Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not” (Matthew 11:20).
1. If you could see Christ standing here tonight, 
His thorn crown'd head and pierced hands could view; 
Could see those eyes that beam with heavn's own light, 
And hear Him say, "Beloved, 'twas for you:"

2. If you could see that face so calm and sweet, 
Those lips that spake words only pure and true; 
Could see the nailprints in His tender feet, 
And hear Him say, "Beloved, 'twas for you:" 

3. He whispers to your heart, turn not away, 
For He's beside you, in your narrow pew; 
If you will listen, you will hear Him say 
in loving tones "Beloved, 'twas for you."    

CHORUS.
Would you believe ( &c), and Jesus receive ( &c), 
If He were standing here ( &c, were standing here)? &c
(Final)Will you believe ( &c), and Jesus receive ( &c), 
Now he is standing here ( &c, is standing here). &c
