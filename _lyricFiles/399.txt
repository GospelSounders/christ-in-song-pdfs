##HAPPY DAY
##(L. M. P.)
. O, happy day! that fixed my choice 
On Thee, my Saviour and my God; Well may this glowing heart rejoice, 
And tell its raptures all abroad. 
2. 'Tis done, the great transaction's done; 
I am my Lord's and 
He is mine; He drew me, and 
I followed on, 
Rejoiced to own the call divine. 
3. Now rest, my longdivided heart, 
Fixed on this blissful center, rest; Nor ever from thy Lord depart, 
With Him of ev'ry good possessed. 
Happy day, happy day, When 
Jesus washed my sins away! 
He taught me how to watch and pray, 
And live rejoicing ev'ry day; 
Happy day, happy day, When 
Jesus washed my sins away!
