##SAFE WITHIN THE VAIL

. "Land ahead! " its fruits are waving O'er the hills of fade less green, 
And the living waters laving 
Shores where heav'nly forms are seen. 
2. Onward bark! the cape 
I'm rounding; See the blessed wave  their hands! 
Hear the harps of God resounding 
From the bright immortal bands! 
3. Now we're safe from all temptation, All the storms of life  are past; 
Praise the Rock of our salvation, 
We are safe at home at last! 
Rocks and storms I'll fear no more, 
When on that eternal shore; 
Drop the anchor! furl the sail! 
I am safe within the vail!
