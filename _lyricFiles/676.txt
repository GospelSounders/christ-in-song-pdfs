##FOR THOSE AT SEA
##(Melita. L. M. 6L.)
. Eternal Father! strong to save, 
Whose arm doth  bind the  restless wave, 
Who bidst the mighty ocean deep 
Its own ap pointed  limits keep: 
O hear us when we cry to 
Thee For those in peril on the sea! 
2. O Saviour! whose almighty word 
The winds and  waves submissive heard, 
Who walkedst on the foaming deep, 
And calm amidst its  rage didst sleep: 
O hear us when we cry to 
Thee For those in peril on the sea! 
3. O Sacred Spirit! who didst brood 
Upon the  chaos  dark and rude, 
Who bad'st its angry tumult cease, 
And gavest  light and  life and peace: 
O hear us when we cry to 
Thee For those in peril on the sea!
