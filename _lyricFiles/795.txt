##SPEND AND BE SPENT
##(All Saints. L. M.)
. Go, la bor on; spend, and  be spent, 
Thy joy  to do  the 
Father's will: It is  the  way the 
Master went; Should not the serv ant tread  it still? 
2. Go, la bor on; 'tis not  for naught; 
Thine earth ly loss  is heav'n ly gain: Men heed  thee,  love thee, praise thee not: The 
Mas ter prais es,â€” what  are men? 
3. Toil on,  and in thy toil  rejoice; 
For toil  comes rest;  for ex ile home; Soon shalt  thou  hear the 
Bridegroom's voice, The mid night peal:  "Behold,  
I come! "
