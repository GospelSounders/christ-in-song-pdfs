##EVERY DAY AND HOUR
##“...Without me ye can do nothing” (John 15:5).
. Saviour, more than life to me, 
I am clinging, clinging close to Thee; Let Thy precious blood applied, Keep me ever, ever near 
Thy side. 
2. Thro' this changing world below, 
Lead me gently, gently as 
I go, Trusting Thee, 
I cannot stray, I can never, never lose my way. 
3. I would love Thee more and more, 
Till this fleeting, fleeting life is o'er, Till my soul is lost in love In a brighter, brighter world above. Ev'ry day, ev'ry hour, 
Let me Ev'ry day and hour, ev'ry day and hour.   feel Thy cleansing pow'r. 
May Thy tender love to me 
Bind me closer, closer, 
Lord, to Thee.
