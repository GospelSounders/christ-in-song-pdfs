. For all the saints who from their labors rest,  
Who Thee by faith before the  world confessed, 
Thy Name, O Jesus, before ever 
2. Thou wast their Rock, their 
Fortress, and their Might;  
Thou, Lord, their Captain, in the  wellfought fight; 
Thou, in the darkness their true guiding 
3. O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,  
Fight as the saints who nobly  fought of old, 
And win with them the victor's crown of 
4. And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,  
Steals on the ears the distant  triumphsong, 
And hearts are brave again, and arms are } 
Alleluia! Alleluia!
