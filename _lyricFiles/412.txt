##AT THY FEET
##(Serenity. C. M.)
. O Lord, who hidest all our shame Beneath Thy crimsoned hand, 
We feel Thy touch, we trust Thy name, 
We yield to Thy command. 
2. We had no courage in the strife, No shelter in retreat; 
But Thou hast glorified our life,— 
We lay it at Thy feet. 
3. Be Thou our King— our hearts are 
Thine— Do with us as Thou wilt, 
So nevermore 
Thy love divine 
Be wounded for our guilt. 
4. We ask no ease nor joyous hours To use for self alone; 
Take Thou our thoughts, our ransomed pow'rs, 
And make them all Thine own.
