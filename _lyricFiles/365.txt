##PERFECT
##(Ortonville. C. M.)
. Let all the heathen writers join To form one perfect book;  Great God, if once compared with 
Thine, How  mean their writings look!  How mean their writings look!  
2. Not the most perfect rules they gave Could show one sin forgiv'n,  Nor lead one step beyond the grave; But  Thine conducts to heaven,  But Thine conducts to heaven.  
3. Yet men would fain be just with 
God By works their hands have wrought;  But Thy commands, exceeding broad, Extend to every thought,  Extend to every thought.  
4. Our faith, and love, and every grace, Fall far below 
Thy word;  But perfect truth and righteousness Dwell  only in the 
Lord, Dwell only in the 
Lord.
