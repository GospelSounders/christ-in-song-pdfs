##SECURE
##(Ortonville. C. M.)
. How shall the young secure their hearts, 
AndI  guard their lives from sin?  
ThyI  word the choicest rules imparts, 
To  keep the conscience clean,  To keep the conscience clean.  
2. 'Tis like the sun, a heav'nly light, 
That guides me all the day;  
And thro' the dangers of the night, 
A  lamp to lead our way,  A lamp to lead our way.  
3. Thy precepts make me truly wise;  hate the sinner's road;   hate my own vain thoughts that rise, 
But  love Thy law, my 
God,  But love Thy law, my 
God.  
4. Thy word is everlasting truth; 
How pure is every page!  
That holy book shall guide my youth, 
And  well support my age,  And well support my age.
