##ONE SWEETLY SOLEMN THOUGHT
##“...Now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly...” (Hebrews 11:16).
. One sweetly solemn tho't,  
Comes to me o'er and o'er;  
I'm nearer to  my home today, Than e'er  
I've been before.  
2. Nearer my Fa ther's house,  
Where many man sions be;  
Nearer the throne  where 
Jesus reigns, Nearer  the crystal sea.  
3. Nearer my go ing home,  
Laying my bur dens down,  
Leaving my cross  of heavy grief, Wearing  my starry crown.  Nearer my home,  
Nearer my home; Nearer my home  today, today, 
Than e'er  I've been before.
