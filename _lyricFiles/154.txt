##DEPTHS OF MERCY
##(Aletta. 7s.)
. Depth  of mercy! can there be Mer cy still reserved  for me? 
Can my God His wrath forbear? Me, the chief of sin ners, spare? 
2. I  have long withstood  
His grace, Long  provoked 
Him to  His face, 
Would not hearken to 
His calls, Griev'd  Him by a thou sand falls. 
3. There  for me the Sav iour stands, Shows His wounds and spreads  His hands; 
God is love! I know, 
I feel; Je sus weeps, and loves  me still.
