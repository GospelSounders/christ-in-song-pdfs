##WHAT HAST THOU DONE?
##Miss F. R. Havergal
##J. E. White
1. I gave My life for thee,  My precious blood  I shed,  
That thou might'st ransom'd be,   And quicken'd from the dead,  
I gave, I gave  My life for thee, What hast thou giv'n  for Me?  
I gave, I gave  My life for thee, What hast thou giv'n  for Me?  

2. My Father's house  of light,  My glorycir cled throne,  
I left for earth ly night,   For wand'rings sad and lone;  
I left, I left  it all for thee, Hast thou left aught  for 
Me?  I left, I left  it all for thee, Hast thou left aught  for Me?

3. I suffered much  for thee,  More than thy tongue  can tell,  
Of bitt'rest ag ony,   To rescue thee from hell;  
I've borne, I've borne  it all for thee, What hast thou borne  for Me?  
I've borne, I've borne  it all for thee, What hast thou borne  for Me?
