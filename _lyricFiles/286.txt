##MORE LIKE JESUS
##(7s. D.)
. More like Jesus would 
I be; Let my Saviour dwell with me, 
Fill my soul with peace and love, Make me gentle as a dove; 
More like Je sus while 
I go, Pilgrim in  this world below; 
Poor in Spirit would I be— 
Let my Saviour dwell in me. 
2. If He hears the raven's cry; If His ever watchful eye 
Marks the sparrows when they fall, Surely He  will hear my call, 
He will teach  me how to live, All my sim ple tho'ts forgive; 
Pure in heart I still would be— 
Let my Sav iour dwell in me. 
3. More like Jesus when 
I pray, More like Jesus day by day; 
May I rest me by 
His side, When the tran quil waters glide; 
Born of Him,  thro' grace renew'd, By His love  my will subdued, 
Rich in faith I still would be— 
Let my Sav iour dwell in me.
