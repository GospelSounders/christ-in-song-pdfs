##TAKE ME AS I AM

1. Jesus, my Lord,  to Thee I cry; Unless Thou help me I must die; 
Oh, bring Thy free salvas tion nigh, And take me as I am.  

2. Helpless I am,  and full of guilt, But yet Thy blood for me was spilt; 
And Thou canst make me what  Thou wilt, But take me as I am.  

3. No preparation can I make, My best resolves I only break; 
Yet save me for Thine own  names' sake, And take me as I am.  

4. I bow before  Thy mercy seat, Behold me, Saviour, at Thy feet; 
Thy work begin, Thy work  complete, And take me as I am.  


5. If Thou hast work  for me to do, Inspire my will, my heart renew; 
And work both in, and by me, too, And take me as I am.  

6. And when at last  the work is done, The battle fought, the vict'ry won, 
Still, still my cry shall be  alone, Lord, take me as I am.  

REFRAIN.
Take me as  I am (Take me, take  me as I am),  
Take me as  I am (Take me, take  me as I am),  
Oh, bring Thy free salvation nigh, 
And take me as I am.
