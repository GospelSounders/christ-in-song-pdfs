##BEAR ME ON
##(C. M.)
. O how I long to see that day 
When the redeemed shall come  
To Zion, clad  in white array— 
Their blissful, happy home. 
2. I'll hear the alleluias roll 
From the unnumbered throng,  
And with a heaven enraptured soul 
I'll join redemption's song. 
3. All hail! the morn of glory's nigh 
The pilgrim longs to see,  
That dries the tear from every eye— 
Creation's jubilee. 
O bear  me on, bear  me on 
To Mount  Zion; O bear me on to that city of love 
Where saints shall ever dwell.
