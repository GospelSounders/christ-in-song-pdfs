##CHIDE MILDLY THE ERRING
##Anon.
. Chide mildly the erring, 
Kind language endears,  
Grief follows the sinful, 
Add not to their tears;  
Avoid with reproaches 
Fresh pain to bestow;  The heart that is strick en 
Needs never a blow.  
2. Chide mildly the erring, 
Jeer not at their fall;  
If strength be but human, 
How feeble were all!  
What marvel that foot steps 
Should wander away,  When tempests so dark en 
Life's wearisome way?  
3. Chide mildly the erring, 
Entreat them with care;  
Their natures are mortal, 
They need not despair.  
We all have some frail ty, 
We all are unwise;  The grace which redeems  us 
Must come from the skies.
