##HIS PROTECTION
##(Trust. 8s, 7s.)
. Call Jeho vah thy sal vation, 
Rest  beneath th' Almight y's  shade; 
In His secret hab i tation 
Dwell, and  never  be dis mayed. 
2. Since, with pure  and firm affection, 
Thou on God hast set  thy  love, 
With the wings of His protection, 
He will shield thee  from a bove. 
3. Thou shalt call  on Him in trouble, 
He  will hearken, He  will  save; 
For thy grief reward thee double, 
Crown with  life beyond the  grave. 
Amen.
