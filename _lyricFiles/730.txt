##GOD HAS SAID
##(Shepherd. 8s  7s.)
. God has said, "Forever blessed  
Those who seek Me in their youth; 
They shall find the path of wisdom,  
And the narrow way of truth." 
Guide us, Saviour, guide us, 
Saviour In the narrow way of truth; Guide us, 
Saviour, guide us, Saviour 
In the narrow way of truth. 
2. Be our strength, for we are weak ness;  
Be our wisdom and our guide. 
May we walk in love and meek ness,  
Nearer to our Saviour's side: 
Naught can harm us, naught can harm us While we thus in 
Thee abide; Naught can harm us, naught can harm us 
While we thus in Thee abide.
