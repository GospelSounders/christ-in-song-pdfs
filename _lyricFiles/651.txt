##NEVER STAND STILL
##(Anew. P.M.)
. Come,  let us anew our His journey pursue, 
Roll have round with the year, 
And  never stand still till the Mas ter appear,  
And  never stand still till the Mas ter appear. 
2. His adorable will let us  gladly fulfill, 
And  our talents improve, 
By the patience of hope, and the la bor of love,  
By the patience of hope, and the la bor of love. 
3. Our  life as a dream, our  time as a stream, 
Glides  swiftly away, 
And the fugitive moment refus es to stay,  
And the fugitive moment refus es to stay. 
4. O, that each in the day of  coming may say, 
"I  fought my way thro'; 
I have finished the work 
Thou didst give  me to do,  
I have finished the work 
Thou didst give  me to do." 
5. O, that each from his 
Lord may receive the glad word, 
"Well and faithfully done! 
Enter into My joy, and sit down  on My throne,  
Enter into My joy, and sit down  on My throne."
