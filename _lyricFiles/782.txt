##GOD, OUR REFUGE
##(Miller. L. M.)
. God is  the refuge of 
His  saints When storms  of sharp  distress invade;  
Ere we can offer our complaints, 
Behold  Him present with   
His aid. 
2. Loud may  the troubled ocean  roar; In sa cred peace our souls abide;  
While ev'ry nation, ev'ry shore, 
Trembles,  and dreads the swell  ling tide. 
3. Zion  enjoys her Monarch's  love, Secure  against  a threat'ning hour;  
Nor can her firm founda tions move, 
Built on  His truth, and armed   with pow'r.
