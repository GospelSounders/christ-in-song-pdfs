##MUSIC IN MY SOUL
##“Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy
. My heart's a tuneful harp when Christ abides within, 
There's music in the name of Jesus; But 
Satan always strikes the chords of doubt and sin; I love the gentle touch of Jesus. 
2. How cheering is the voice of heav'nly melody! 
How diff'rent is the world's complaining! And we may make the choice of what this life shall be, With promise of the life remaining. 
3. When we are dead to 
Self, then are we dead to sin; 
"An undivided heart," says Jesus; Till then the Prince of Peace cannot abide within, With Self there is no room for Jesus. 
4. Don't bind the giant down, nor lay him on the shelf, 
Nor leave him dead on 
Sinai's mountain; There's only one sure way to rid the heart of 
Self,— A burial deep in 
Calv'ry's fountain. 
5. Then Love begins her life of work, and song, and prayer, 
With not a moment lost in sighing; To save a dying world, is all her tho't and care, For love is more than selfdenying. O there's music, sweetest music. 
There's music in the name of 
Jesus; O there's music, heav'nly music, 
With O there's mu sic inmy soul, sweet est mu sic inmy soul,  music in the name of   O there's mu sic ev'ry day, heav'n ly mu sic allthe way,  Jesus in my soul.
