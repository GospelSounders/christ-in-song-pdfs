##YOUR SAVIOUR, TOO
##S. O’Mally Cluff
##S. O’Mally Cluff, Chorus added
1. I have a Saviour, He's pleading in glory, 
A dear, loving Saviour, tho' earth friends be few; 
And now  He is watching in tenderness o'er me, 
And O  that my Saviour were your Saviour too!

2. I have a Father: to me  He has given 
A hope for eternity, blessed and true; 
And soon  will He call me to meet Him in heaven, 
But O that I might  hear Him welcome you too! 

3. A robe fair and spotless, resplendent in whiteness, 
Is waiting in glory my wondering view; 
And when  I receive it all shining in brightness, 
Dear friend,  I would see  you receiving one too! 

4. To me has been given a peace  like a river— 
A peace that the friends of this world never knew; 
And Christ  is the Author, and Christ  is the Giver, 
And O  that His peace  might be given to you! 

5. When Jesus has found you, tell others the story, 
That my loving Saviour is your Saviour too; 
Then pray  that your Saviour may bring  them to glory, 
And prayer  will be an  'twas answered -for you! 

CHORUS.
Your Saviour, too, Your Saviour, too; 
My Saviour bids me tell you, He's your Saviour, too.
