##HOLY, HOLY
##(Nic√¶a. 11s  12s.)
.Holy, holy, holy!  Lord  
God Almighty! Early in the morn ing our song shall rise to 
Thee; Holy, holy, holy,  merciful and mighty! God over all, who  rules eternity. 
2.Holy, holy, ho ly!  an gels adore Thee, Casting down their bright  crowns around the glassy sea; Thousands and ten thou sands  worship low before 
Thee, Which wert and art and  evermore shalt be. 
3.Holy, holy, ho ly!  though  darkness hide Thee, Though the eye of man  
Thy great glory may not see; Only Thou art ho ly;  there is none beside 
Thee, Perfect in pow'r, in  love and purity.
