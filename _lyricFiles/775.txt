##SUN OF MY SOUL
##(Hursley. L. M.)
. Sun of my soul,  O 
Sav iour dear! It is not night  if Thou  be near; 
O may no earthborn cloud arise To hide Thee from  Thy ser vant's eyes. 
2. When soft the dews  of kind ly sleep My weary eye lids gen tly sleep, 
Be my last thoughtâ€”  how sweet to rest Forever on  my Sav iour's breast! 
3. Abide with me  from morn  till eve, For without 
Thee  I can not live; 
Abide with me  when night is nigh, For without 
Thee  I dare  not die. 
4. Be near and bless  me when  I wake, Ere thro' the world  my way  I take; 
Till in the   cean of 
Thy love I lose myself  in heav'n  above.
