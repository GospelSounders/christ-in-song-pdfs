##MY SAFETY
##(Chenies. 7s, 6s. D.)
. O Lamb of God! still keep me Near to Thy wounded side; 
'Tis only there in safety 
And peace I can abide! 
What foes and snares surround me, 
What doubts and fears within! 
The grace that sought and found me, 
Alone can keep me clean. 
2. 'Tis only in Thee hiding I know my life secure— 
Only in Thee abiding, 
The conflict can endure: 
Thine arm the victory  gaineth 
O'er ev'ry hateful foe; 
Thy love my heart sustaineth 
In all its cares and woe. 
3. Soon shall my eyes behold 
Thee, With rapture face to face; 
One half hath not been told me 
Of all Thy pow'r and grace. 
Thy beauty, Lord, and glo ry, 
The wonders of Thy love, 
Shall be the endless story 
Of all the saints above.
