##JESUS, COME AND BLESS US
##E. R. Latta
. Jesus, Thou hast promised 
That where two or three  
In Thy name have gathered, 
Thou wilt present be;  
And Thy word  believing, 
Now in pray'r we kneel;  
Jesus, come and bless us; 
Lord, Thyself reveal.  
2. Jesus, Thou hast met us 
Oft in seasons past,  
But we need Thy presence 
With us till the last;  
Come, O blessed Saviour, 
And Thy grace display;  
Hear us and accept us; 
Bless us while we pray.  
3. Jesus, tune our voices 
To Thy songs of praise;  
Be in each petition 
That to Thee we raise;  
May our faith  grow stronger, 
And our hope more bright;  
May our love be purer, 
And our path more light.  
Jesus, come  and bless us 
While we linger here;  Jesus, come  and bless  us, 
Be Thou ever near.
