##COME, MY SOUL
##(Seymour. 7s.)
. Come, my soul, thy suit pre pare! 
Jesus loves to answer pray'r; 
He Himself has bid thee pray, 
Therefore will  not  say thee nay. 
2. With my burden I be gin; 
Lord, remove this load of sin; 
Let Thy blood, for sinners  spilt, 
Set my conscience   free from guilt. 
3. Lord, I come to Thee for  rest, 
Take possession of my breast; 
There, Thy soverign right main tain, 
And without  a  rival reign.
