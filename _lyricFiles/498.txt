##GIVE ME THE BIBLE
##“Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path” (Psalm 119:105).
. Give me the Bible, star of gladness gleaming, 
To cheer the wand'rer lone and tempest tossed; 
No storm can hide that peaceful radiance beaming, 
2. Give me the Bible when my heart is broken, 
When sin and grief have filled my soul with fear; 
Give me the precious words by 
Jesus spoken, 
3. Give me the Bible, all my steps enlighten, 
Teach me the danger of these realms below; 
That lamp of safety, o'er the gloom shall brighten, 
4. Give me the Bible, lamp of life immortal, 
Hold up that splendor by the open grave; 
Show me the light from heaven's shining portal, 
Since Jesus came to seek and save the lost. Give me the 
Bible,— Holy message shining, 
Thy light shall guide me in the narrow way. 
Precept and promise, law and love combining, 
Till night shall vanish in eternal day.
