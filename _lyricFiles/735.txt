##GUARD THY CHILDREN
##(Greenville. 8s  7s. D.)
. Gracious  Father, guard 
Thy children From the  foe's destruc tive  pow'r; Save, O  save them, 
Lord, from falling In this dark and try ing hour. 
Thou wilt  surely prove 
Thy people, All our graces must be tried; 
But Thy  Word illumes our path way, 
And in  God we still  con fide. 
2. We are in the time of wait ing; Soon we  shall behold  our  
Lord, Wafted  far away from sor row, To re ceive our rich  re ward. 
Keep us, Lord, till Thine appear ing, Pure, unspotted from the world; 
Let Thy  Holy Spirit cheer  us 
Till Thy  banner is unfurled.
