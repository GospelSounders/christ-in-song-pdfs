##IT IS WELL WITH MY SOUL
##“He hath delivered my soul in peace...” (Psalm 55:18).
. When peace like a river attend eth my way, 
When sorrows like seabillows roll; 
Whatever my lot, 
Thou hast taught me to say, 
"It is well, it is well with my soul." 
2. Tho' Satan should buffet, tho' tri als should come, 
Let this blest assurance control, 
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate, 
And hath shed His own blood for my soul. 
3. My sin— O the bliss of the glo rious tho't! — 
My sin, not in part, but the whole, 
Is nailed to His cross and I bear it no more; 
Praise the Lord, praise the 
Lord, O my soul! 
4. And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight, 
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll, 
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend; 
"Even so"— it is well with my soul.        It is well   with my with my soul, 
It is well, it is well with my soul.
