##HASTEN ON, GLAD DAY
##“...In the time of harvest I will say to the reapers...gather the wheat into my barn” (Matthew 13:30).
. The world's glorious harvest is fast drawing on, 
The Master is calling 
His reapers to come; 
The grain bright and golden, in fields far and near, 
Is ripe for the garner when 
He shall appear. 
2. That morn everlasting, that day free from tears 
Is swiftly approaching as on roll the years; 
The wheat, rudely scattered by sin's cruel blast, 
Then hasten to gather e'er autumn be past. 
3. O sweet is the labor that floweth from love! — 
A stream never failing, whose Fount is above; 
'Tis love that invites us, 'tis love points the field, 
'Tis love wields the sickle,— and wondrous the yield. Hasten on,     glad day,    
Bear the sheaves     away;   
Hasten on,     glad day,    
Bear  us  home. Hasten on, angel reapers,  come, glad  day, 
Bear the sheaves to the garner,  far away; 
Hasten on, angel reapers,  come, glad  day, 
Bring the "harvest home."
