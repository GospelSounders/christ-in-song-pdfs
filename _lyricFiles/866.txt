##WE’LL NEVER SAY GOOD-BY
##“...The voice of weeping shall be no more heard....”
. With friends on earth we meet in gladness, 
While swift the moments fly,  
Yet ever comes the tho't of sadness, 
That we must say, "Goodby."  
2. How joyful is the hope that lingers, 
When loved ones say "Farewell,"  
That we, when all earth's toils are ended, 
With them shall ever dwell.  
3. No parting words shall e'er be spoken 
In yonder home so fair,  
But songs of joy, and peace, and gladness, 
We'll sing forever there.  
We'll never say goodby in heav'n, 
We'll never say goodby,  In that fair land of joy and song 
We'll never say goodby.
