##ENDLESS LOVE
##(Gratitude. L. M.)
. My God!  how end less is  Thy love! Thy gifts  are ev'ry even ing new; 
And morning mercies from  above, Gently  distil, like ear ly dew. 
2. Thou spread'st  the cur tain of  the night, Great Guar dian of  my sleep ing hours! 
Thy sov 'reign word  restores the light, And quickens all  my drow sy pow'rs. 
3. I yield  my pow'rs  to 
Thy  command; To Thee  
I con secrate  my days; 
Perpet ual blessings, from  
Thy hand, Demand  perpet ual songs  of praise.
