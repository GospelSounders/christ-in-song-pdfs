##MY SABBATH SONG
##Mrs. Mary A. Kidder
. Strains  of music oft en greet me, 
As I join the busy throng,  
But  there's nothing half  so pleasant, 
As the ho ly Sabbath song.  
2. 'Tis  a song of love  and mercy, 
Speaking peace  to all mankind,  
Tell ing sinners poor  and needy, 
Where the Sav iour they  may find.  
3. While  I live, O, may  I ever 
Love the ho ly Sabbath song, 
And  in yonder home  eternal, 
Sing it with  the blood bought throng.  
No fear of ill,  no fear of wrong,  
While I can sing my Sabbath song:  
My Sabbath song,  my Sabbath song,  
I love to sing my Sabbath song.
