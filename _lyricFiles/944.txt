##MEET AGAIN
##L. S. Hall
. Meet again when time is o'er, 
Meet again to part  no more; 
How it cheers the drooping heart, 
When from friends we're called to part.  
2. Meet again where endless joy 
We shall taste without  alloy; 
Meet where songs shall ne'er grow old, 
Sweetly tuned to harps of gold.  
3. Meet again,â€” how passing sweet, 
Friends long lost again to meet! 
Careworn souls, by tempests driv'n, 
O how sweet to meet in heav'n!
