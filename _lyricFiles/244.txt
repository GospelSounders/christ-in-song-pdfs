##PEACE ON EARTH
##Luke 2:14
. "Peace upon earth! " the angels sang, "Goodwill unto men! " the chorus rang, 
"Glory to God! " the 
Christ has come, His bright star shines in the clear blue dome. 
2. "Peace upon earth! " 'tis sounding still, "Glory unto 
God, to men goodwill! " 
Bethlehem's song, 'tis caught from far, And lifted up to that glow ing star. 
3. "Jesus has come! " it echoes wide, Thro' valley and plain, on mountain side; 
But not alone the angels sing, For even children the an them ring. 
4. Yes! let them sing, for 
Christ has laid His hand with a blessing on their head; 
Sweeter to Him than angels' tones Are songs that come from 
His lit tle ones. Joyously sing, Joyously sing, Joyously sing, Joyously sing!    
Joy ously,   Joy ously,   
Joy ously    Shout hallelujah to 
Christ, our King!
