##ON TIME
##F. E. Belden
. List to the chime, 'tis meet ing time, 
The joyous bells are ringing; 
This is the day, they seem to say, 
To meet for pray'r and singing. 
2. Join with the throng and swell  the song, 
The Saviour's love confessing; 
Offer a pray'r that you  may share 
The fulness of His blessing. 
3. Learn of the way, and then  obey 
The truth so kindly given; 
Thus, may you say, each clos ing day; 
I'm nearer home and heaven. 
Ring, ring, ring, ring, Ring, ye joy ous bells;  
Ring, ring, ring, ring, Ring, ye joyous bells.  
(Last)On time, on time, Answer to  the chime;  
On time, on time, Always here on time.
