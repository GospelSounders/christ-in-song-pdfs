##GIVE ME JESUS
##Fanny J. Crosby
.Take the world, but give me 
Jesus, All its joys are but a name; 
But His love abideth ever, 
Thro' eternal years the same. 
2.Take the world, but give me 
Jesus, Sweetest comfort of my soul; 
With my Saviour watching o'er me, 
I can sing, tho' billows roll. 
3.Take the world, but give me 
Jesus, Let me view 
His constant smile; 
Then thro'out my pilgrim journey 
Light will cheer me all the while. 
4.Take the world, but give me 
Jesus, In His cross my trust shall be; 
Till, with clearer, brighter vision, 
Face to face my Lord 
I see. Oh, the height and depth of mercy! 
Oh, the length and breadth of love! 
Oh, the fullness of redemption, 
Pledge of endless life above!
