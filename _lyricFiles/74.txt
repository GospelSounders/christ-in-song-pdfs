1. Sing them over again to me, Wonderful words of Life;  
Let me more of their beauty see, Wonderful words of Life;  
Words of life and beauty, Teach me faith  and duty, 

2. Christ, the blessed One, gives to all, Wonderful words of Life;  
Sinner, list to the loving call, Wonderful words of Life;  
All so freely given, Wooing us  to heaven, 

3. Sweetly echo the gospel call, Wonderful words of Life;  
Offer pardon and peace to all, Wonderful words of Life;  
Jesus, only Saviour, Sanctify forever, 

CHORUS.
Beautiful words, wonderful words, 
Wonderful words of Life;   
Beautiful words, wonderful words, 
Wonderful words of Life;
