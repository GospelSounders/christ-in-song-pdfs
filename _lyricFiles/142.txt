##CLEANSED
##(Hubert. S. M. D.)
. Cast  out the buyers, 
Lord, The  sellers bid depart; 
Cleanse  me from carnal thought and word, 
And purify my heart. 
A  temple would I be, Meet  for the royal 
Son: Ye  moneychangers, fear and flee 
Before the Sinless 
One. 
2. The  love of self o'erthrow; The  love of God bring in, 
That  ministers to all below, 
God's remedy for sin. 
Rise  up! Thou Living 
Word, Thine  arm of strength lay bare, That  naught in me henceforth beheard 
But voice of praise and pray'r. 
3. When  Thou this robber's home Becomes a house of pray'r, 
Do  Thou with all Thy power come, 
And dwell forever there,— 
The  hopeless ones to cheer, And  broken hearts make whole; In  me do Thou alone appear 
To ev'ry sinsick soul.
