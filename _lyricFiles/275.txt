##VALLEY LILIES
##Flora Kirkland
. Valleylilies, meek and lowly, 
Let  me hear your mes sage sweet, 
Tell of Christ the pure and holy, 
Bend ing as  to touch  
His feet. 
2. Valleylilies, golden hearted, 
Love's  sweet mis sion you  fulfill, 
For you tell in perfumed language, 
How  He wrought  His Fath er's will. 
3. Valleylilies, cups inverted, 
Still  the Mas ter you proclaim: 
Empty of all pomp and glory, 
To  redeem  the world  
He came. Snowy lilies of  the valley, 
Speak again your message rare; 
Testify to me of Jesus, 
Heaven's Lily, wondrous fair!
