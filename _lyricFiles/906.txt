##A FEW MORE YEARS
##(Bonar. S. M. D.)
. A few more years shall roll, 
A few more seasons come, 
And we shall meet the loved who now 
Are sleeping in the tomb: 
2. A few more storms shall beat 
On this wild, rocky shore, 
And we shall be where tempests cease, 
And surges swell no more: 
3. A few more struggles here, 
A few more partings sore, 
A few more toils, a few more tears, 
And we shall weep no more: 
4. 'Tis but a little while, 
And He shall come again 
Who died that we might live, who lives 
That we with Him may reign: 
Then, O my Lord, prepare My soul for that great day; 
O, wash me in Thy precious blood, 
And take my sins away.
