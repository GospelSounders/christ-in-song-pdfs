##WAITING AND WATCHING
##“Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching...” (Luke 12:37).
. We know not the time when 
He cometh, At even, or midnight, or morn;  
It may be at deepening twilight, It may be at earliest dawn.  
He bids us to watch and be ready, Nor suffer our lights to grow dim;  
That when He shall come, 
He may find us, All waiting and watching for 
Him.  
2. I think of His wonderful pity, The price our salvation hath cost:  
He left the bright mansions of glory To suffer and die for the lost.  
And sometimes I think it will please Him, When those whom 
He died to redeem,  
Rejoice in the hope of His coming By waiting and watching for 
Him.  
3. O Jesus, my loving 
Redeemer, Thou knowest 
I cherish as dear  
The hope that mine eyes shall behold 
Thee, That I shall Thine own welcome hear!  
If to some as a Judge 
Thou appearest, Who forth from 
Thy presence would flee, 
A Friend most beloved I'll greet Thee, I'm waiting and watching for 
Thee.  Wait  ing  and watch  ing, Wait  ing  and watch  ing; Wait  ing  and watch  ing, Still Waiting and watching, yes, waiting for 
Thee, Waiting and watching, yes, waiting for 
Thee; Waiting and watching, yes, waiting for 
Thee;  waiting and watching for 
Thee.
