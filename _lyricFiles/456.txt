##HOW PLEASANT
##(Burton. L. M.)
. How pleasant, how divinely fair, 
O Lord of hosts, Thy dwellings are! With long desire my spirit  faints To meet th'assemblies of the saints. 
2. Blest are the souls that find a place 
Within the temple of Thy grace; There they behold 
Thy gentle  rays, And seek 
Thy face and learn Thy praise. 
3. Blest are the men whose hearts are set 
To find the way to 
Zion's gate: God is their strength; and thro' the  road They lean upon their helper, 
God.
