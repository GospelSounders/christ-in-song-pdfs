##GOOD NIGHT
##“When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid...and thy sleep shall be sweet” (Proverbs 3:24).
. When softly fades the dying day,     
And  mortal cares we fold away,  
Then with the last faint ray of light  
All nature seems to say 
Good night. 
2. And when the deeper shadows fall,     
And  nature veil as with a pall,  
Then pray'rs of evening take their flight  
From lips that softly say 
Good night. 
3. O Father, give us sweet repose     
From  all our earthly cares and woes,  
And grant that heav'n may greet our sight  
When we have said our last 
Good night. Good night,     good  night,  
May angels  bright, (pure and bright,) 
Their vigils keep till morning light.     
Good  Good night, good night,   
Good  night, good night, 
May angels  ev er  birght, (pure and bright,) 
Their vigils keep till  morning light,   
Good  night, good night, 
Good night, good night. (good night).
