##ASLEEP IN JESUS
##(Rest. L. M.)
. Asleep in Jesus! Blessed sleep 
From which none ever wakes to weep; 
A calm and undisturbed repose, 
Unbroken by the last of foes. 
2. Asleep in Jesus! O how sweet 
To be for such a slumber meet! 
With holy confidence to rest 
In hope of being ever blest. 
3. Asleep in Jesus! Peaceful rest, 
Whose waking is supremely blest; 
No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour 
That manifests the Saviour's pow'r. 
4. Asleep in Jesus! Soon to rise, 
When the last trump shall rend the skies; 
Then burst the fetters of the tomb, 
And wake in full, immortal bloom.
