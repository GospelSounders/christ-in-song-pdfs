##HAPPY SONGS
##â€œAnd the multitude that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David:
. Long ago the children sang a song 
Of praise to Jesus as He rode along:  
2. As of old He loves to hear us sing 
Our songs of praise to 
Him, our heav'nly King: 
"Ho
3. By and by we'll sing a sweeter song 
With all the saved, a glad and glorious throng:          sanna  in the highest! " 
Happy songs, happy songs, 
Let the children sing their happy, happy songs; 
Happy songs, happy songs, 
Jesus loves to  hear our songs.
