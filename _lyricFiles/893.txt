##WE SHALL KNOW
##“...Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face...” (I Corinthians 13:12).
. When the mists have rolled in splendor 
From the beauty of the hills, And the sunshine, warm and tender, 
Falls in kisses on the rills, 
We may read love's shining letter 
In the rainbow of the spray; 
We shall know each other better 
When the mists have cleared away. 
2. If we err in human blindness, 
And forget that we are dust, If we miss the law of kindness 
When we struggle to be just, 
Snowy wings of peace shall cover 
All the errors of today, 
When the weary watch is over, 
And the mists have cleared away. 
3. When the mists have ris'n above us, 
As our Father knows 
His own, Face to face with those that love us, 
We shall know as we are known; 
Far beyond the orient meadows 
Floats the golden fringe of day; 
Heart to heart we bide the shadows, 
Till the mists have cleared away. 
We shall know  as we are known,  
Nevermore to walk alone, 
In the dawning of the morning, 
When the mists  have cleared away; 
In the dawning of the We shall know    as we are known,   Never moreto walk a lone,In the dawning of the morning,   When the mists have cleared away, have cleared a way;In the dawning   morning, 
When the mists  have cleared away (have cleared away).
