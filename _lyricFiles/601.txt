##PRECIOUS PROMISE
##Nathaniel Niles
. Pre cious promise 
God  hath given To  the weary pass erby, 
On  the way from earth to heaven, 
"I  will guide thee with  
Mine eye." 
2. When  temptations al most win thee, And  thy trusted watchers fly, 
Let  this promise ring  within thee, 
"I  will guide thee with  
Mine eye." 
3. When thy secret hopes  have perished In  the grave of years  gone by, 
Let  this promise still be cherished, 
"I  will guide thee with  
Mine eye." 
4. When  the shades of life  are falling, And  the hour has come  to die, 
Hear  the trusty Pi lot calling, 
"I  will guide thee with  
Mine eye." I  will guide thee, 
I  will guide thee, I  will guide thee with  
Mine eye; On  the road from earth  to heaven, 
I  will guide thee with  
Mine eye.
