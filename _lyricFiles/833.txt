##HOW SHALL I COPY HIM?
##(Germany. L. M.)
. How shall I follow 
Him  I serve? How shall 
I copy Him   I love? 
Not from those blessed footsteps swerve  Which lead me to  His seat  above? 
2. Lord, should my path thro' suff 'ring lie, Forbid that I should e'er   repine; 
Still let me turn  to 
Calvary,  Nor heed my grief,  rememb'ring 
Thine. 
3. O let me think how 
Thou  didst leave Thy heav'nly home of pure delights, 
To fast, to faint,  to watch, to grieve,  Thro' toilsome days, thro' lone ly nights! 
4. All this Thou didst, then died  for me! Thou camest not Thyself to please; 
And, dear tho' earth ly comforts be,  Shall 
I not love  Thee more  than these?
