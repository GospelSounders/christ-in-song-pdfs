##WALK IN THE LIGHT
##(Chopin. C. M.)
. Walk in the light! so shalt thou know 
That fellowship of  love 
His Spirit only can bestow 
Who reigns in light  above, 
Who reigns in light   above. 
2. Walk in the light! and thou shalt own 
Thy darkness passed  away; 
Because that light on thee hath shone 
In which is perfect day, 
In which is perfect day. 
3. Walk in the light! and e'en the tomb 
No fearful shade shall  wear; 
Glory shall chase away its gloom, 
For Christ hath con quered there, 
For Christ hath con  quered there. 
4. Walk in the light! and thine shall be 
A path, tho' thorn y,  bright; 
For God, by grace, shall dwell in thee, 
And God Himself  is light, 
And God Himself   is light.
