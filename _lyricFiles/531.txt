##URGE THEM TO COME
##Dr. C. R. Blackall
. In the highways and hedges go seek for the lost,  Gather them into the fold, Was the earnest command that our 
Saviour divine  Taught 
His disciples of old. 
2. If the Shepherd we love, we will care for the sheep:  Precious are they in 
His sight; They are out in the desert, they wander alone;  Lead  them from darkness to light. 
3. To the weary and thirsty the 
Saviour has said,  "Come, heavy laden, to Me, I will give you to drink of the water of life;"  Tell  them the fountain is free. 
4. There's a welcome for all in the kingdom of grace,  All who repent and believe; And the souls that have stray'd and returned to the fold,  Je sus will gladly receive. 
Urge them to come, show them the way; 
Tenderly, lovingly, bring them today; 
Urge them to come, why should they roam? 
Bring them along  to our dear 
Saviour's home.
