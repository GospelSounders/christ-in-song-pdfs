##THY PRESENCE HERE
##(Marlow. C. M.)
. God of the universe, to Thee These sacred walls  we rear; 
And now, with songs and bended knee, 
Invoke Thy presence here. 
2. When sad with care, by sin oppressed, Here may the bur dened soul 
Beneath Thy shelt'ring wing find rest; 
Here make the wounded whole. 
3. And when the last long 
Sabbath morn Upon the just  shall rise, 
May all who own Thee here, be borne 
To mansions in the skies.
