##IN THE VINEYARD
##(Neander. 8s  7s. 6L.)
. In the vineyard of our 
Father, Daily  work we find to do; 
Scatter'd gleanings we may gather, 
Though we  are but young and few; 
Little clusters, little clusters, 
Help to fill the garners too. 
2. Toiling early in the morning, Catching  moments thro' the day, 
Nothing small or lowly scorning 
While we  work, and watch, and pray; 
Gath'ring gladly, gath'ring gladly 
Freewill off'rings by the way.
