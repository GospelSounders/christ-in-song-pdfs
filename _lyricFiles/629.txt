##HARVEST HOME
##(Dresden. 7s, 6s, with Cho.)
. We plough the fields and scatter The good seed on the land, 
But it is fed and watered 
By God's almighty hand; 
He sends the snow in winter, 
The warmth to swell the grain, 
The breezes, and the sunshine, 
And soft, refreshing rain. 
All good gifts around us, 
Are sent from heav'n above, 
Then thank the Lord, O thank the 
Lord, For all His wondrous love. 
2. We thank Thee, loving 
Father, For all things bright and good, 
The seedtime and the har vest, 
Our life, our health, our food. 
No wealth have we to offer, 
For all Thy love imparts, 
But that which Thou desirest, 
Our humble, thankful hearts. 
Best of all Thy blessings, 
To earth the Saviour came, 
That we may rise and win the prize, Of endless life with 
Him. 
3. Shall we not give for others, As God to us has giv'n, 
Own all mankind as broth ers, 
And help them on to heav'n? 
We bring our off'rings gladly, 
And speed the message on, 
Of Christ and His salvation, 
To all beneath the sun. 
Quickly, blessed Master, 
O may Thy kingdom come! 
At Thy command, in ev'ry land, We speed the "harvest home."
