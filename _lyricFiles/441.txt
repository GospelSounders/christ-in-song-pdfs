##BID OUR DOUBTINGS CEASE
##(Stockwell. 8s  7s.)
. Let Thy Spirit, blessed 
Saviour, Taught Come and bid our doubtings cease; 
Come, O come with love and favor, Fill us all with joy and peace. 
2. Fearful dangers are around us,  Satan watches to destroy; 
Lord, our foes would fain confound us; O for us Thy might  employ! 
3. On Thy word our souls are resting;   by 
Thee, Thy name we love; 
Sweetest of all names is 
Jesus; How it doth our spirits move!
