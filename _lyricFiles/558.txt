##LIFETIME IS WORKING TIME
##“...Workers together with him...” (II Corinthians 6:1).
. Lifetime is working time, spend no idle days; 
Jesus is calling thee on the harvest ways; 
Working with a willing hand, sing a song of praise;  Work, ever work for 
Jesus! 
2. Lifetime is working time, learn where duty lies; 
Grasp ev'ry passing day as a precious prize; 
Glad to help the sorrowing, glad to sympathize;  Work, ever work for 
Jesus! 
3. Lifetime is working time, do thy honest part; 
Tho' in discouragements, bear a cheerful heart; 
Trusting Jesus as thy friend, ne'er from 
Him depart;  Work, ever work for 
Jesus! Work, work, work, work, 
Swiftly the hours of labor fly,  
Freighted with love let work, work,  work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work,  work, work, each pass by!  
There is joy in labor for the struggling neighbor. 
Work ever work for Jesus!
