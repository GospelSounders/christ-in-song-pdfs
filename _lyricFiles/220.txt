##IN THE BEAUTY OF HOLINESS
##“O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness” (Psalm 96:9).
. O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness, 
Bow down before Him, 
His glory proclaim; 
With gold of obedience,  and incense of lowliness, 
Kneel and adore Him, the 
Lord is His name. 
2. Low at His feet lay thy burden of carefulness, 
High on His heart He will bear it for thee, 
With Comfort thy sor rows, and answer thy prayerfulness, 
Guiding thy steps as may best for thee be. 
3. Fear not to enter 
His courts in the slenderness 
Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine: 
With Truth in its beau ty, and love in its tenderness, 
These are the off'rings to lay on His shrine. 
4. These, tho' we bring them in trembling and fearfulness, 
He will accept for the Name that is dear; 
With Mornings of joy  give for evenings of tearfulness, 
Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.
