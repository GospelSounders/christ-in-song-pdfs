##SEALS MY PARDON
##(Manoah. C. M.)
. I  saw One hanging on the tree, 
In  agony and blood,  
Who fixedis  His languid eyes on me,  As near His cross 
I stood. 
2. O,  never till my latest breath 
Can  I forget that look;  
It seemed  to change me with 
His death,  Tho' not a word 
He spoke. 
3. A  second look He gave, which said, 
"I  freely all forgive;  
This blood  is for thy ransom paid,  I die that thou may'st live." 
4. Thus  while His death my sin displays 
In  all its blackest hue,  
Such   the mystery of grace,  It seals my pardon too.
