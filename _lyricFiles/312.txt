##FAIREST LORD JESUS
##(Crusader, 5, 5, 6, 8, D.)
.Fairest Lord Jesus, 
Ruler of all nature, 
O Thou of God and  man the 
Son! Thee will I cherish, 
Thee will I honor, 
Thou art my glory, joy, and crown. 
2.Fair are the mea dows, 
Fairer still the wood lands, 
Robed in the blooming  garb of spring; Jesus is fair er, 
Jesus is pur er, 
Who makes the woeful heart to sing. 
3.Fair is the sun shine, 
Fairer still the moon light, 
And all the twinkling,  starry host; Jesus shines brigh ter, 
Jesus shines pur er 
Than all the angels heav'n can boast. 
Amen.
