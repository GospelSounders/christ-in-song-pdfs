##STANDING ON THE PROMISES
##“For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us” (II Corinthians 1:20).
. Standing on the promises of Christ my King, Thro' eternal ages let 
His praises ring; 
Glory in the highest, 
I will shout and sing, 
Standing on the promises of 
God. 
2. Standing on the promises that cannot fail, When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail, 
By the living Word of 
God I shall prevail, 
Standing on the promises of 
God. 
3. Standing on the promises 
I now can see Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me; 
Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free, 
Standing on the promises of 
God. 
4. Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord, Bound to 
Him eternally by love's strong cord, 
Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword, 
Standing on the promises of 
God. 
5. Standing on the promises 
I cannot fall, List'ning ev'ry moment to the Spirit's call, 
Resting in my Saviour, as my all in all, 
Standing on the promises of 
God. Stand   ing,  
Stand   ing,  
Standing on the promises of 
God  Stand   ing,  
Stand   ing,  
I'm standing on the promises of 
God.
