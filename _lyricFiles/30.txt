###“...Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth...” (Luke 15:7).
1. Able to  deliver! sound it far and near;  
Able to deliver whosoe'er  will hear;  
From the fiery furnace, from the sinner's doom,  
Jesus will  deliver whosoe'er will come.  

2. Able to deliver! can  it really be?  
Is there any power can deliver me?  
Tell me, tell  me truly, is the Christ  once slain  
Able to deliv er me from Satan's chain?  

3. Able to deliver! courage, trembling one!  
Are you serving Jesus? He will save  His own.  
Fear not Satan's power, cling to Jesus' hand,  
Cease your fear and doubt ing, boldly for Him stand.  

CHORUS.
Able to  deliver, Able now  to save,  
When you are,  my brother, Able to believe.
