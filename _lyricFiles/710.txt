##AS PANTS THE HART
##(Mendelssohn. 11s  10s.)
. As pants the wear ied hart for cooling springs,  
That sinks exhausted in the summer's chase, 
So pants my soul for 
Thee, great King of kings,  
So thirsts to reach 
Thy sacred dwellingplace. 
2. Lord, Thy sure mer cies, ever in my sight,  
My heart shall gladden thro' the tedious day; 
And 'midst the dark and gloomy shades of night,  
To Thee, my God, 
I'll tune the grateful lay. 
3. Why faint, my soul?  why doubt 
Jehovah's aid?  
Thy God the God of mercy still shall prove; 
Within His courts thy thanks shall yet be paid;  
Unquestioned be 
His faithfulness and love.
