##FLEE AS A BIRD
##Mary S. B. Dana
. Flee as a bird to your mountain, 
Thou who art weary of sin;  
Go to the clearflowing 
Fountain, Where you may wash and be clean; 
Fly, for th'avenger is near thee, 
Call, and the Sav iour will hear thee, 
He on His bosom will bear thee, 
O thou who art weary of sin, 
O thou who art weary of sin. 
2. He will protect thee forev  er, 
Wipe ev'ry falling  tear;  
He will forsake thee, oh, nev  er, Sheltered so tenderly there! 
Haste, then, the daylight is fly  ing, 
Spend not the moments  in sighing, 
Cease from your sorrow and cry ing, 
The Saviour will wipe ev'ry tear, 
Yes, Jesus will wipe ev'ry tear.
