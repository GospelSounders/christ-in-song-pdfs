##AGAIN THE DAY RETURNS
##(Freeport. 10s.)
.Again the day returns of holy rest, Which,  when 
He made  the  world, Jehovah blest; 
When, like His own, He  bade our labor's cease, 
And all be  pi  ety, and all be peace. 
2.Let us devote this  consecrated day To  learn 
His will,  and  all we learn obey; 
So shall He hear, when  fervently we raise 
Our supplications, and our songs of praise. 
3.Lord of all worlds, incline 
Thy gracious ear; Thy  children's voice  in  tender mercy hear; 
Bear Thy blest promise,  fix'd as hills, in mind, 
And shed renew  ing grace on lost mankind. 
4.Father in heav'n, in  whom our hopes confide, Whose pow'r defends  us,  and whose precepts guide, 
Thro' life our surest  guardian, and friend, 
Glory supreme   be 
Thine till time shall end.
