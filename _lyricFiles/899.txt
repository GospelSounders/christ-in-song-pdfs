##LAND OF PURE DELIGHT
##(Varina. C. M. D.)
. There is a land of pure delight, 
Where saints immortal reign; 
Infinite day excludes the night, 
And pleasures banish pain. 
There everlasting spring abides, 
And neverwith'ring flow'rs,  
And but a little space divides 
This heav'nly land from ours. 
2. Pure is the land the saints espy, 
And all the region peace; 
No wanton lips nor envious eye 
Can see or taste the bliss. 
Those holy gates forever bar 
Pollution, sin, and shame;  
None shall obtain admittance there 
But foll'wers of the 
Lamb. 
3. O could we make our doubts remove 
Those gloomy thoughts that rise, 
And see the Canaan that we love, 
With unbeclouded eyes; 
Could we but climb where Moses stood, 
And view the landscape o'er,—  
Not all this world's pretended good 
Could ever charm us more.
