##NEVER ALONE
##“...Lo, I am with you alway...” (Matthew 28:20).
. Lonely? no,  not lonely 
While Jesus standeth by;  
His presence always cheers me; 
I know that He is nigh. 
Frendless? no,  not friendless, 
For Jesus is my Friend;  
I  change, but 
He  remaineth, The same unto  the end. 
2. Weary? no,  not weary 
While leaning on His breast;  
My soul hath full  enjoyment, 
In His eternal rest. 
Helpless? yes,  so helpless; 
But I am leaning hard  
On the mighty arm of Jesus, And 
He is keep ing guard. 
3. Waiting? yes,  I'm waiting; 
He bids me watch and wait;  
I only wonder often, 
What makes my Lord so late. 
Joyful? yes,  so joyful, 
With joy too deep for words;  
A  precious, sure  foundation, The joy that is  my Lord's. 
No, never alone,    no, never alone; 
He has 
No, no,   nev era lone,
No, no,   nev era lone;promised never to leave me,  
Never to leave me alone.  
No, never alone,    no, never alone; 
He has 
No, no,   nev era lone,
No, no,   nev era lone;promised never to leave me,  
Never to leave me alone.
