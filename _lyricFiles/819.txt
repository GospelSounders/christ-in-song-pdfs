##LET US WORK TOO
##F. E. B.
. The Lord worketh, let us work too; 
In His vineyard there's much to do, 
And souls perish for need of 
You: The Lord worketh, let us work too. 
2. The world moveth, let us move too, 
The Sun's glory that we may view, 
From night turning to daydawn new: The world moveth, let us move too. 
3. The wrong speaketh, let us speak too; 
The worst error is bright with dew; 
Shall truth slumber the whole day thro'? The wrong speaketh, let us speak too. 
4. The Christ liveth, let us live too, 
From death waking, His work to do, 
With hearts loving and pure and true: The Christ liveth, let us live too.
