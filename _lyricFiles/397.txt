##REJOCE AND BE GLAD
##Horatius Bonar
. Rejoice and be glad, the 
Redeemer has come; 
Go  look on His cradle, 
His cross, and His tomb. 
2. Rejoice and be glad, for the Lamb that was slain, 
O'er  death is triumphant, and liveth again. 
3. Rejoice and be glad, for our King is on high, 
He  pleadeth for us on 
His throne in the sky. 
4. Rejoice and be glad, for 
He cometh again, 
He  cometh in glory, the Lamb that was slain. 
Sound His praises, tell the story 
Of Him who was slain; Sound 
His praises, tell with gladness, He liveth again.  
Final: He cometh again.
