##COME, YE SINNERS
##(8s.  7s. D.)
. Come, ye sinners, poor and  need y, 
Weak and wounded, sick and sore; 
Jesus ready stands you're to  save you, 
Full of pity, love, and pow'r. 
2. Now ye needy, come  and  welcome,  
God's free bount y glorify; 
True belief and true  repent ance, 
Ev'ry grace  that brings you nigh. 
3. Let not conscience make  you  lin ger, 
Nor of fit ness fondly dream; 
All the fitness He requir eth 
Is to feel  our need of 
Him. 
4. Come, ye weary, heav yla den, 
Bruised and man gled by the fall, 
If you tarry till    bet ter, 
You will nev er come at all. Turn to the Lord, and seek salvation, 
Sound the praise of His dear name; 
Glory, honor, and  salvation, 
Christ the Lord  is come to reign.
