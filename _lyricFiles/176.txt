##I WILL NOT LET THEE GO
##(Selena. L. M. 6L.)
. Come, O Thou Traveler unknown, Whom still I hold, but cannot see; 
My company before is gone, 
And I am left alone with 
Thee; With Thee all night 
I mean to stay, And wrestle till the break of  day. 
2. I need not tell Thee who 
I am; My sin and misery declare; 
Thyself hast called me by my name, 
Look on Thy hands, and read it there; But who, I ask 
Thee, who art Thou? Tell me Thy name, and tell me  now. 
3. In vain Thou strugglest to get free; I never will unloose my hold; 
Art Thou the Man that died for me? 
The secret of Thy love unfold; Wrestling, I will not let Thee go, Till 
I Thy name, Thy nature  know.
