##WAKE THE SONG OF JOY AND GLADNESS
##Anniversary Song
. Wake the song of joy and gladness, Hither bring your noblest lays; 
Banish ev'ry tho't of sadness, 
Pouring forth your highest praise, 
Sing to Him whose care has brought us Once again with friends to meet, And whose loving voice has taught us Of the way to Jesus' feet. 
2. Joyfully with songs and ban ners, We will greet the festal day; 
Shout aloud our glad hosan nas, 
And our grateful homage pay. 
We will chant our Saviour's glory While our tho'ts we raise above, Telling still "the old, old story," Precious themeâ€” 
Redeeming love! 
3. Thanks to Thee, O holy 
Fa ther, For the mercies of the year; 
May each heart, as here we gath er, 
Swell with gratitude sincere, 
Thanks to Thee, O loving 
Saviour, For redemption thro' 
Thy blood: Breathe upon us, 
Holy Spirit, Sweetly draw us near to God. Wake the song,    wake the Song, the song of joy and gladness, 
Wake the song, wake the song, The song of jubilee.
