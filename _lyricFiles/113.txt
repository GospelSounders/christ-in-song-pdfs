##GOD CALLING YET
##(Welton. L. M.)
. God calling yet! shall 
I not hear? Earth's pleasures shall I  still  hold  dear? 
Shall life's swift passing years all fly, And still my soul in slumber lie? 
2. God calling yet! shall 
I not rise? Can 
I His loving  voice  despise, 
And basely His kind care repay? He calls me still; can I delay? 
3. God calling yet! and shall He knock, And 
I my heart the  closer  lock? 
He still is waiting to receive, And shall I dare His Spirit grieve? 
4. God calling yet! and shall I give No heed, but still in  bon dage  live? 
I wait, but He does not forsake: He calls me still; my heart, awake! 
5. God calling yet! I cannot stay; My heart I yield without  delay; 
Vain world, farewell! from thee 
I part; The voice of 
God hath reached my heart.
