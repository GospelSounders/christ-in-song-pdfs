##LOYALTY TO THE MASTER
##“...A faithful ambassador...” (Proverbs 13:17).
. Loyalty to the Master, loyalty to the King, Loyalty now and ever, cheerfully let us sing;  Wholly at 
His commandment let ev'ry soldier be, 
Joyfully serving Jesus, serving with loyalty. 
2. Loyalty to the Master, letting 
Him lead the way, Glorious is 
His banner, follow it ev'ry day;  Into the midst of battle, conquering as we go, 
Victory He has promised over the deadly foe. 
3. Loyalty to the Master, looking to Him alone, Turning away from evil, Jesus will keep 
His own;  Onward, still onward pressing, seeing the starry prize 
Waiting for all the faithful, meeting beyond the skies. 
Loyal soldiers, let us joyfully march along, 
For ward, for ward, with a triumphant song; 
Onward, upward, a happy and loyal throng, 
Loyal to our Saviour and our 
King.
