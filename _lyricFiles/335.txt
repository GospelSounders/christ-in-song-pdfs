##O WORSHIP THE KING!
##(Lyons. 10s  11s.)
. O worship the King, all glorious above, And  gratefully sing 
His won derful love; 
Our Shield and Defender, the 
Ancient of Days, 
Pavilion'd in splendor, and girded with praise. 
2. O tell of His might and sing of 
His grace, Whose  robe is the light; whose canopy, space; 
His chariots of wrath the deep thunder clouds form, 
And  dark is His path on the wings  of the storm. 
3. Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite? It  breathes in the air, it shines in the light; 
It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain, 
And  sweetly distills in the dew  and the rain. 
4. Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail, In  Thee do we trust, nor find  Thee to fail; 
Thy mercies, how tender! how firm to the end! 
Our  Maker, Defender, 
Redeem er, and Friend.
