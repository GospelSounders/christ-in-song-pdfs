##TAKE ALL MY SIN AWAY
##J
. O spotless Lamb! I come to 
Thee, No longer can 
I from Thee stay; Break ev'ry chain, now set me free, Take all my sin away. 
2. Weary I am of inbred sin, Oh, wilt Thou not my soul release? Enter and speak me pure within, Give me Thy perfect peace. 
3. I plunge beneath Thy precious blood, My hand in faith takes hold of Thee; Thy promises just now 
I claim; Thou art enough for me. 
Take all my sin away, Take all my sin away; 
O spotless Lamb, I come to 
Thee; Take all my sin away. 
(Last)He takes my sin away, He takes my sin away. 
O spotless Lamb, I come to 
Thee; He takes my sinaway.
