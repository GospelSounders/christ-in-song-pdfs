##THE DAY AWAKES
##(Sankey. 11s  10s.)
.Again the day awakes in wondrous beauty, 
And all the shadows of the midnight flee. 
Safe gain we gird ourselves for loving duty, 
And lift our thankful hearts, 
O God, to Thee. 
2.Look from the height of heav'n, and send to cheer us 
Thy light and truth, and guide us onward still; O let Thy mercy, as of old, be near us, 
And lead us safely to 
Thy holy hill. 
3.So, when that morn of endless light is waking, 
And shades of evil from its splendors flee,  may we rise, this earth's dark vale forsaking, 
Thro' all the long, bright day to dwell with Thee.
