##THE NINETY AND NINE

1. There were ninety and nine that safely lay In the shelter the of the fold, 
But  one  was out on the hills away, Far He off from the gates that of gold;
Away on the mountains wild and bare, 
Away from the tender Shepherd's care, Away from the tender Shepherd's care. 

2. "Lord,  Thou  hast here Thy ninety and nine; Are they not enough for Thee?" 
But the Shepherd made answer:  "One of Mine Has  wander'd away from Me, 
And although  the road  be rough and steep, I go to the desert to find  My sheep, 
I go to the desert to find  My sheep." 

3. But none of  the ransom'd ever knew How  deep were  waters cross'd; 
Nor how dark was the night that the Lord pass'd thro' Ere  found His sheep  was lost,   
Out in the desert He heard its cry,â€”  Sick  and helpless, and read to die,  
Sick  and helpless, and read to die. 

4. "Lord,  whence are these blood drops all  the way That  mark out the mountain's track?" 
"They were shed  for one who had gone astray, Ere the Shepherd  could bring him back." 
"Lord,  why are Thy hands  so rent and torn?" "They are pierc'd tonight  by many a thorn, 
They are pierc'd tonight  by many a thorn." 

5. But all through  the mountains, thunder riven, And  up from the rocky steep, 
There  rose  a cry to the gate of heaven, "Rejoice, I have  found  My sheep! " 
And the angels sang  around the throne, "Rejoice, for the Lord  brings back His own! 
Rejoice, for the Lord  brings back  His own!"
