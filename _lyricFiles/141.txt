##THY WORK ALONE
##(Hubert. S. M. D.)
. Not  what these hands have done, Can  save this guilty soul; Not  what this toiling flesh has borne, 
Can make my spirit whole. 
Thy  work alone, my 
Lord, Can  ease this weight of sin; Thy  blood alone, O 
Lamb of God, Can give me peace within. 
2. Not  what I feel or do, Can  give me peace with 
God; Not  all my prayers, or sighs, or tears, 
Can ease my awful load. 
Thy  love to me, O 
God, Not  mine, O Lord, to 
Thee, Can  rid me of this dark unrest, And set my spirit free. 
3. No  other work save 
Thine, No  meaner blood will do; No  strength, save that which is divine, 
Can bear me safely through. 
I  praise the God of grace, I  trust His love and might. He  calls me His, I call Him mine; My God, my joy, my light.
