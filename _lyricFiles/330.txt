##I SING THE POWER OF GOD
##(Varina. C. M. D.)
. I sing the mighty pow'r of 
God, That made the mountains rise, 
That spread the flowing seas abroad, And built the lofty skies; I sing the wisdom that ordained 
The sun to rule the day;  
The moon shines full at 
His command, And all the stars obey. 
2. I sing the goodness of the 
Lord, That fill'd the earth with food; 
He formed the creatures with 
His word, And then pronounced them good. Lord, how 
Thy wonders are displayed 
Where'er I turn my eye!  
If I survey the ground I tread, Or gaze upon the sky! 
3. There's not a plant or flow'r below But makes Thy glories known; 
And clouds arise, and tempests blow, By order from 
Thy throne. Creatures that borrow life from Thee 
Are subject to Thy care;  
There's not a place where we can flee But God is present there.
