##SWEEPING THROUGH THE GATES
##â€œ...Come, ye blessed of my Father,
. Who, who are these beyond the chilly wave, 
Just past the borders of the silent grave, 
Shouting Jesus' pow'r to save? 
2. These, these are they who in their youthful days 
Found Jesus early, and in wisdom's ways 
Proved the fulness of 
His grace, 
3. These, these are they who in affliction's woes, 
Ever have found in 
Jesus calm repose, 
Peace which from a pure heart flows, 
4. These, these are they who in the conflict dire, 
Boldly have stood amid the hottest fire; 
Jesus now says, "Come up higher;" 
5. Safe, safe upon the evershining shore, 
Sin, pain, and death, and sorrow all are o'er; 
Happy now and evermore, Washed in the blood of the 
Lamb. Sweeping thro' the gates to the 
New Jerusalem, Washed in the blood  of the 
Lamb;   Sweeping thro' the gates to the 
New Jerusalem, Washed in the blood of the 
Lamb.
