##WORK FOR THE SCHOOL
##A. A. G. By permission
. Let us work for the school with our hearts and our hands; 
Let it never, no never, decline: 
For its praises are sung by the good in all lands 
That are blest with the gospel divine. 
2. 'Tis perfum'd by the pray'rs, 'tis bedewed by the tears 
Of the holy, the active, the true; 
They rejoiced at its hopes, and they mourned at its fears, 
When its friends were but feeble and few. 
3. Now the sunshine of favor illumines its path 
And the church spreads above it her wing; 
'Tis a source of her weal, 'tis a source of her worth, 
And a gem in the crown of her 
King. Rally then, rally then, stand by the school; 
Why should it languish and die? 
Rally then, rally then, stand by the school; 
Why should it languish and die?
