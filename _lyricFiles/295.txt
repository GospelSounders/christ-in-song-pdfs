##WALKING WITH GOD
##(Morton. L. M. 6L.)
.O letI me walk with 
Thee,  my God, As Enoch walked in days  of old; 
Place Thou my trembling hand in 
Thine, And sweet communion with  me hold; 
E'en tho' the path I may  not see, Yet, Jesus, let me walk with 
Thee. 
2.I can not, dare not walk  alone; The tempest rages in  the sky; 
A thousand snares beset  my feet, A thousand foes  are lurk ing nigh; 
Still Thou the raging of  the sea; O Mas ter, let me walk with 
Thee. 
3.If  may rest my hand in Thine, I'll count the joys of earth  but loss, 
And firmly, bravely jour ney on; I'll bear the ban ner of  the cross 
Till Zion's glorious gates  
I see: Yet, Sav iour, let me walk with 
Thee.
