##ON OUR WAY REJOICING
##(St. Alban. 6s, 5s. D.)
. On our way rejoicing, 
As we homeward move, 
Hearken to our praises, 
O Thou God of love! 
Is there grief or sadness? 
Thine it cannot be!  
Is our sky beclouded? 
Clouds are not from Thee! 
2. If with honesthearted 
Love for God and man, 
Day by day Thou find us 
Doing what we can; 
Thou who giv'st the seed time, 
Wilt give large increase,  
Crown the head with blessings, 
Fill the heart with peace. 
3. On our way rejoicing, 
Gladly let us go; 
Conquered hath our Leader, 
Vanquished is our foe! 
Christ without, our safe ty; 
Christ within, our joy;  
Who, if we be faithful, 
Can our hope destroy? 
4. Unto God the Father 
Joyful songs we sing; 
Unto God the Saviour thankful hearts we bring; 
Unto God the Spir it 
Bow we and adore,  
On our way rejoicing 
Now and evermore! 
On our way rejoicing,  
As we homeward move, Hearken to our praises,  
O Thou God of love!
