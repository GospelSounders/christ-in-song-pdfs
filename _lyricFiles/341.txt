##THY GLORY FILLS THE HEAVENS
##(Faben. 8s  7s. D.)
.Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven; 
Earth is with its fulness stored;  
Unto Thee be glory given, 
Holy, holy, holy 
Lord! Heav'n is still with anthems ringing; Earth takes up the angel's cry,  
Holy, holy, holy, singing, Lord of hosts, Thou 
Lord most high. 
2.Ever thus in God's high praises, 
Brethren, let our tongues unite;  
While our tho't His greatness raises, 
And our love His gifts excite: With His seraph train before 
Him, With His holy church below,  
Thus unite we to adore 
Him, Bid we thus our anthem flow. 
3.Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven, 
Earth is with its fulness stored;  
Unto Thee be glory given, 
Holy, holy, holy 
Lord! Thus Thy glorious name confessing, We adopt the angel's cry,  
Holy, holy, holy, blessing Thee, the Lord our 
God most high!
