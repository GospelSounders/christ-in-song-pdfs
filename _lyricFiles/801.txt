##THE MERCY SEAT
##(Retreat. L. M.)
. From  every storm y wind that blows, 
From  every swelling tide of woes, 
There is a calm, a sure retreat; 
'Tis  found above  the mercyseat.  
2. There  is a scene  where spirits blend, 
Where  friend holds fel lowship with friend; 
Though sundered far, by faith they meet 
Around one com mon mercyseat.  
3. Ah!  whither should  we flee for aid, 
When  tempted, desolate, dismayed? 
Or how the hosts of sin defeat, 
Had  suff'ring saints  no mercyseat?
