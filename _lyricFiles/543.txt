##LIFT! BROTHER, LIFT!
##“If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me...” (Matthew 16:24).
. When the cross seems hard to carry, 
Lift! brother, lift! O'er the burden never tarry, 
Lift! brother, lift! 
2. Duty's call is selfdenying, 
Lift! brother, lift! Half the battle lies in trying, 
Lift! brother, lift! 
3. When the evil seems the strongest, 
Lift! brother, lift! Lift the hardest, lift the longest, 
Lift! brother, lift! Lift the cross and clasp it tighter, 
Lift! brother, lift!  Lifting makes the burden lighter, 
Lift! brother, lift!
