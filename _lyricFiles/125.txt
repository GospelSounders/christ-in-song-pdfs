##COME UNTO ME
##(Henley 11s. 10s.)
. Come unto Me when shadows darkly gather, 
When the sad heart is weary and distressed; 
Seeking for comfort from your heav'nly 
Father, Come unto 
Me, and I will give you rest. 
2. Large are the mansions in my 
Father's dwelling, 
Glad are those homes that sorrows never dim; 
Sweet are the harps in holy music swelling, Soft are the tones that raise the heav'nly hymn. 
3. There, like an Eden blossoming in gladness, 
Bloom the fair flow'rs by earth so rudely pressed; 
Come unto Him all ye who droop in sadness, "Come unto 
Me, and I will give you rest."
