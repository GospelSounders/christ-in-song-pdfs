##KEEP THOU OUR LIPS
##(Mason. L. M.)
. Eternal Father, 
God  of love, Creator of  the universe, Pour out Thy Spirit from above, 
As from Thy temple we disperse. 
2. Keep Thou our lips, that all  we say May honor 
Thee,  our God and King; That our example day by day 
May teach the sacred truths we sing. 
3. Direct our wayward steps  aright, Our Guide and 
Guard  forev er be; In 
Thine eternal arms of might 
Enfold and draw us near er 
Thee.
