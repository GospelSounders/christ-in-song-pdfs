##LET THE LITTLE ONES COME

##“...Forbid them not, to come unto me...” (Matthew 19:14).
1. I  think when I read that sweet story of old, 
When  Jesus was here among men,  
How He call'd little children as lambs to His fold, 
I should like to have been with them then.  
I  wish that His hands had been placed on my head, 
That His arm had been thrown around me,  
And that I might have seen His kind look when He said, 
"Let the little ones come unto Me."  

2. Yet  still to the Saviour in pray'r I may go, 
And  ask for a share in His love, 
And  if I thus earnestly seek Him below, 
I shall see Him and hear Him above.  
In that beautiful place He has gone to prepare 
For  all who are wash'd and forgiv'n,  
Oh,  may we at last find a glad welcome there, 
Safe at home in the kingdom of heav'n.
