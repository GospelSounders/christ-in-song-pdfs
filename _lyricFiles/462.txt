##IN SWEET COMMUNION
##(Greenville. 8s. 7s. D.)
. From the  table now retiring, 
Which for  us the Lord  hath spread,  
May our souls,  refreshment finding, 
Grow in  all things like  our 
Head.  His example while beholding, 
May our  lives His image bear; 
Him our  Lord and Master calling, 
His commands may we  revere.
