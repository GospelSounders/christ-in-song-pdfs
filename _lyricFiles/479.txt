##RESCUE THE PERISHING
##â€œ...Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in,
. Rescue the perishing, Care for the dying, 
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave; Weep o'er the erring one, 
Lift up the fallen, 
Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save. 
2. Tho' they are slighting 
Him, Still He is waiting, 
Waiting the penitent child to receive. Plead with them earnestly, 
Plead with them gently; 
He will forgive if they only believe. 
3. Down in the human heart, Crush'd by the tempter, 
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore; Touched by a loving heart, 
Wakened by kindness, 
Chords that were broken will vibrate once more. 
4. Rescue the perishing, Duty demands it, 
Strength for thy labor the 
Lord will provide; Back to the narrow way 
Patiently win them; 
Tell the poor wand'rer a 
Saviour has died. Rescue the perishing, 
Care for the dying; Jesus is merciful, 
Jesus will save.
