##ANYWHERE WITH JESUS
##“...I will trust, and not be afraid...” (Isaiah 12:2).
. Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,  
Anywhere He leads me in this world below;  
Anywhere without 
Him, dearest joys would fade,  
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.  
2. Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone,  
Other friends may fail me, 
He is still my own;  
Tho' His hand may lead me over dreary ways,  
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.  
3. Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,  
When the gloomy shadows round about me creep,  
Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;  
Anywhere with Jesus will be home sweet home.  
Anywhere! anywhere! 
Fear I cannot know;  Anywhere with 
Jesus I can safely go.
