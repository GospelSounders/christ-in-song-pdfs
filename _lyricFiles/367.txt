##HIS LOVING KINDNESS
##(L. M.)
. Awake, my soul,  to  joyful lays, 
And  sing thy great   Redeemer's praise; 
He  justly claims  a song from me,  
His  loving kindness, O how free! 
Loving kindness, loving kindness, 
His  loving kindness, O how free! 
2. He saw me ru in'd  in the fall, 
Yet  lov'd me notwithstanding all; 
He  sav'd me from  my lost estate,  
His  loving kind  ness, O how great! 
Loving kind ness, loving kind ness, 
His  loving kind  ness, O how great! 
3. Tho' num'rous hosts  of  mighty foes, 
Tho'  earth and hell my way oppose, 
He  safely leads  my soul along,  
His  loving kind  ness, O how strong! 
Loving kind ness, loving kind ness, 
His  loving kind  ness, O how strong! 
4. When trouble, like  a  gloomy cloud, 
Has  gather'd thick   and thunder'd loud, 
He  near my soul  has always stood,  
His  loving kind  ness, O how good! 
Loving kind ness, loving kind ness, 
His  loving kind  ness, O how good!
