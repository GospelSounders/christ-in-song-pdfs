##BEAUTIFUL CITY
##“Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious...” (Revelation 21:11).
. Beautiful city, haven of peace, 
Beautiful home where weeping shall cease; 
When shall thy gates be opened to me? 
When shall I rest forever in thee? 
2. Beautiful city, haven of joy, 
Heavenly praise our tongues shall employ; 
Glad are thy songs that never grow old, 
Bright are thy walls of jasper and gold. 
3. Beautiful city, haven of rest, 
Beautiful mansions, home of the blest; 
O how I long thy glories to see! 
Beautiful city, waiting for me.       haven of peace, 
Home of the soul, where weeping shall cease; 
Beautiful city, waiting for me, 
When shall I rest  forever in thee?
