##A CRY FROM MACEDONIA
##Fanny J. Crosby
. There's a cry from Macedonia— 
Come and help us; The light of the precious gospel bring, Let us hear the joyful tidings of salvation, 
We thirst for theli ing spring. O ye heralds of the cross, be up and doing, 
Remember the Saviour's great command, Go ye forth and preach the word to ev'ry creature, 
Proclaim it in ev'ry land. 
They shall gather from the 
East, They shall gather from the West, With the patriarchs of old; 
And the ransom'd shall return 
To the kingdom of the blest, 
With their harps and crowns of gold. 
2. O, how beautiful their feet upon the mountains, The tidings of peace from 
God who bring, To the nations of the earth who sit in darkness, 
And tell them ofZ on's 
King; Then, ye heralds of the cross, be up and doing, 
Go work in your blessed 
Master's field, Sound the trumpet, sound the trumpet of salvation, 
The Lord is yourstrength  and shield. 
Let the distant isles be glad, Let them hail the 
Saviour's birth, And the news of pardon free, 
Till the knowledge of the truth 
Shall extend to all the earth, 
As the waters o'er the sea.
