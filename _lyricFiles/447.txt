##THE RISING DAY
##(Litchfield. C. M.)
. Once  more, my  soul, the rising day Salutes thy waking  eye; 
Once  more, my voice, sun thy  tribute, pay To  Him who rules on high. 
2. Night  unto  night His name repeats, The  day renews the  sound, 
Wide  as the heav'ns  on  which 
He sits To  turn the sea sons round. 
3. O  God, may  all my hours be 
Thine, While  I enjoy the  light; 
Then  shall my   in  smiles decline, And  bring a peace ful night.
