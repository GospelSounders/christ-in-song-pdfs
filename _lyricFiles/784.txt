##BE NEAR US
##(Wilmot. 8s  7s.)
God . of  our salvation,  hear us; 
Bless, O bless us, ere  we  go; 
When we join the world,  be  near us, 
Lest we cold and careless grow. May 2. we  live in view of  heaven, 
Where we hope to see  Thy  face; 
Let Thy Spirit's light  be  given, 
All our hidden paths to trace. As 3. our  steps are drawing nearer 
To the place we call  our  home, 
May our view of heav'n  grow clearer, 
Hope more bright of joys to come.
