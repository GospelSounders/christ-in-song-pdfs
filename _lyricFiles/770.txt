##GOD, OUR KEEPER
##(Root. 7s.)
. God of love that hearest prayer, 
Kindly for Thy people care, 
Who on  Thee alone depend,  
Love us, save us to the end. 
2. Save us in the prosp'rous hour, 
From the flatt'ring tempter's pow'r, 
From his  unsuspected wiles,  
From the world's pernicious smiles. 
3. Cut off our dependence vain 
On the help of feeble man; 
Ev'ry  arm of flesh remove;  
Stay us only on 
Thy love! 
4. Men of worldly, low design, 
Let not these Thy people join; 
Save us  from the great and wise,  
Till they sink in their own eyes.
