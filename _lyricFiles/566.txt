##I’LL GO WHERE YOU WANT ME TO GO
##“...Whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go” (Joshua 1:16).
. It may not be on the mountain's height, 
Nor over the stormy sea;  
It may not be at the battle's front 
My Lord will have need of me;  
But if by a still, to small voice He calls To paths that 
I do not know,  I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand  in 
Thine, I'll go where You want me to go.  
2. Perhaps today there are loving words 
Which Jesus would have me speak,  
There may be now in the paths of sin 
Some wand'rer whom I should seek;  
O Saviour, if Thou  wilt be my guide, Tho' rugged and dark  the way,  My voice  shall echo Thy mes sage sweet, I'll say what You want me to say.  
3. There's surely somewhere a lowly place 
In earth's harvest fields so wide,  
Where I may labor thro' life's short day 
For Jesus, the crucified;  
So, trusting my all  
Thy tender care, And knowing 
Thou lov est me,  I'll do  
Thy will with a heart  sincere, I'll be what You want me to be.         go, dear 
Lord, Over mountain, or plain,  or sea;  
I'll say what You want me to say,  dear 
Lord, I'll be what You want me to be.
