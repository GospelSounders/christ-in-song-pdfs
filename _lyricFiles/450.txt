##A THOUSAND TONGUES
##(Christmas. C. M.)
. O  for a thousand tongues to  sing My  great Redeemer's  praise!  
The  glories of my 
God and King, The  triumphs of 
His grace,  The triumphs of 
His grace. 
2. Jesus, the name that calms our  fears, That  bids our sorrows  cease,â€”  
'Tis  music in the sinner's  ears, 'Tis  life, and health, and peace,  'Tis life, and health, and peace. 
3. He  breaks the pow'r of cancelled  sin, He  sets the pris'ner  free;  
His  blood can make the foulest  clean, His  blood avails for me,  His blood avails for me. 
4. He  speaks, and list'ning to 
His  voice, New  life the dead receive;  
The  mournful, broken hearts re joice, The  humble poor believe,  The humble poor believe.
