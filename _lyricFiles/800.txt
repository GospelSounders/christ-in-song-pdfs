##SABBATH TWILIGHT
##(Communion. 7s.)
. Softly fades  the twilight ray 
Of  the ho ly Sab bath day, Gen tly as  life's set ting sun 
When  the Christian's course  is run. 
2. Peace  is on  the world  abroad; 
'Tis  the ho ly peace  of 
God, Sym bol of  the peace  within 
When  the spir it rests  from sin. 
3. Sav iour, may  our Sabbaths be 
Days  of joy  and peace  in 
Thee, Till  in heav'n  our souls repose, 
Where  the Sab bath ne'er  shall close.
