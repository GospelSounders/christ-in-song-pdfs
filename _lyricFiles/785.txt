##CONTROL MY WILL
##(Flower. 7s.)
. Prince  of Peace, control  my will, Bid  this strug gling heart be still; Bid  my fears and doub tings cease,  
Hush  my spirit in to peace. 
2. Thou  hast bought me with  
Thy blood, O pen'd wide  the gate to 
God; Peace  I ask, but peace  must be,  
Lord,  in be ing one  with 
Thee. 
3. May  Thy will, not mine,  be done, May  Thy will  and mine be one; Chase  these doubtings from  my heart,  
Now  Thy per fect peace  impart.
