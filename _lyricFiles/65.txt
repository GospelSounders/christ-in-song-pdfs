##LIFE IN A LOOK
##F. E. Belden

##“Look unto me, and be ye saved...” (Isaiah 45:22).
1. There's life in a look at the sacred cross, 
Jesus has said, "Look unto Me;" 
Earth with its riches is only dross, 
Bright treasures beyond in the cross I see. 

2. When first to the Saviour I raised my eyes, 
Sweet was the smile that fell on me; 
Oft as the clouds of temptation rise, 
A look at the cross still my strength shall be. 

3. I'll look to the cross ev'ry day and hour, 
Trusting the promise God has given; 
None ever fall neath the tempter's pow'r, 
Who trust and obey in the strength of Heav'n.         

CHORUS.
In a look   there's life for life for thee (&c),
In a look   at Calvary (&c);   
Blessed thought,   salvation free (&c),   
By a look   at Calvary (&c).
