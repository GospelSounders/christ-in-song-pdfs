##GOD OF MY LIFE
##(Uxbridge. L. M.)
. God of my life, whose gracious pow'r 
Thro' varied scenes my soul hath  led, 
Or turned aside the fa tal hour, 
Or lifted up my sinking head. 
2. I have no skill the snare to shun, 
But Thou, O God, my wisdom  art: 
I ever into dan ger run, 
But Thou art greater than my heart. 
3. I rest beneath Thy kindly shade; 
My griefs expire, my troubles  cease; 
Thou, Lord, on whom my soul  is stayed, 
Wilt keep me still in perfect peace.
