##GLORIOUS THINGS
##(Austria. 8s  7s. D.)
. Glorious things of thee are spoken, 
Zion, city of our  
God: He, whose word cannot be broken, 
Formed thee for His own a bode; 
On the Rock  of Ages founded, What can  shake thy sure repose? 
With salva tion's walls surrounded, Thou mayst  smile at  all thy  foes. 
2. See the streams of living wa ters 
Springing from eternal  love, Well supply thy sons and daugh ters, 
And all fear of want re move; 
Who can faint  while such a riv er Ever  flows their thirst to assuage? 
Grace, which, like  the 
Lord, the Giv er, Never  fails  from  age to  age. 
3. Round each habitation hov 'ring, 
See the cloud and fire ap pear For a glory and a cov 'ring, 
Showing that the Lord is  near; 
Blest inhab itants of 
Zi on, Washed in  the 
Redeemer's blood; 
Jesus, whom  their souls rely  on, Makes them  kings  and  priests to  God. 
4. Saviour, if of Zion's cit y, 
I, thro' grace, a member  am, Let the world deride or pit y, 
I will glory in Thy  name; 
Fading is the worldling's pleas ure, All his  boasted pomp and show; 
Solid joys  and lasting treas ure None but  
Zi on's  children  know.
