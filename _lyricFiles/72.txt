##WHO’LL BE THE NEXT?
##Annie S. Hawks

1. Who'll be the next to follow Jesus? 
Who'll be the next His  cross to bear? 
Someone is ready, someone is waiting; 
Who'll be the next a crown to wear? 

2. Who'll be the next to follow Jesus
Follow His weary  bleeding feet? 
Who'll be the next to lay ev'ry burden 
Down at the Father's mercy-seat? 

3. Who'll be the next to follow Jesus? 
Who'll be the next to  praise His name? 
Who'll swell the chorus of free redemption— 
Sing, hallelujah! praise the Lamb? 

CHORUS.
Who'll be the next? Who'll be the next? 
Who'll be the next to  follow Jesus? 
Who'll be the next to follow Jesus now? 
Follow Jesus now?
