##MAKE ME A BLESSING TO-DAY
##“...And thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not” (Isaiah 58:11).
. O softly the Spirit is whisp'ring to me, 
With tender compassion, with pitying plea; 
I hear His beseeching, and earnestly pray 
That Jesus will make me a blesstoing  today. 
2. Some heart may be longing for only a word, 
Whose love by the Spirit is quickened and stirred; 
Now grant, blessed Saviour, this service to me, 
Of speaking a comforting message for Thee. 
3. Some soul may be plunged in the darkest despair, 
Whose shadows would melt in the sunlight of pray'r; 
O give me, dear Saviour, 
I humbly implore, 
The sweet consolation that soul  restore. 
4. Come, all ye that labor, ye weary and worn, 
Come ye who in sorrow or sinfulness mourn; 
With me this petition to Jesus convey: 
O make me a blessing, dear 
Saviour, today. 
Lord, make me a blessing today, 
A blessing to some one, 
I pray;  In all that I do, in all that 
I  say, O make me a blessing today.
