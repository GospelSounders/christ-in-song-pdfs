##FORWARD! OUR WATCHWORD
##(St. Alban. 6s, 5s. D.)
. Forward! be our watchword, 
Steps and voices joined; 
Seek the things before us, 
Not a look behind; 
Burns the fiery pillar, 
At our army's head;  
Who shall dream of shrinking, By our Captain led? 
2. Forward out of error, 
Leave behind the night; 
Forward thro' the darkness, 
Forward into light! 
Glories upon glo ries 
Hath our God prepared,  
By the souls that love 
Him One day to be shared! 
3. Far o'er yon horizon 
Rise the city towers, 
Where our God abideth; 
That fair home is ours! 
Thither, onward thith er, 
In the Spirit's might,  
Lovers of your country, Forward into light! 
Forward! in the conflict,  
Thro' the toil and fight, 
Foes must fall before  us,  
God will speed the right.
