##LOVEâ€™S INCENSE
##(P. M.)
. Master, no offering Costly and sweet, 
Lay we, like Magdalene, 
Here at Thy feet; Yet may love's incense rise, 
Sweeter than sacrifice, 
Dear  Lord, to Thee,   Dear 
Lord,  to Thee. 
2. Daily our lives would show Weakness made strong, 
Toilsome and gloomy ways 
Brightened by song; Some deeds of kindness done, 
Some souls by patience won, 
Dear  Lord, to Thee,   Dear 
Lord,  to Thee. 
3. Some word of hope, for hearts Burdened with fears, 
Some balm of peace, for eyes 
Blinded with tears, Some dews of mercy shed, 
Some wayward footsteps led, 
Dear  Lord, to Thee,   Dear 
Lord,  to Thee. 
4. Thus, in Thy service, 
Lord, Till eventide 
Closes the day of life, 
May we abide. And when earth's labors cease, 
Bid us depart in peace, 
Dear  Lord, to Thee,   Dear 
Lord,  to Thee.
