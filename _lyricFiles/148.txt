##I BRING MY SINS TO THEE
##F. R. Havergal
. I bring my sins to Thee, 
The sins I cannot count, 
That all may cleansed be, 
In Thy once opened 
Fount: I bring  them,  Saviour, all  to Thee; The bur den  is too  great for me. 
2. I bring my grief to Thee, 
The grief I cannot tell; 
No words shall needed be, 
Thou knowest all so well: I bring  the  sorrow laid  on me, O suf f'ring  
Saviour!  all to Thee. 
3. My heart to Thee I bring, 
The heart I cannot read,â€” 
A faithless, wand'ring thing, 
An evil heart indeed: I bring  it,  Saviour, now  to Thee, That fix'd  and  faithful  it may be. 
4. My life I bring to Thee, 
I would not be my own; 
O Saviour, let me be 
Thine, ever Thine alone. My heart,  my  life, my all,  
I bring To Thee,  my  
Saviour  and my King.
