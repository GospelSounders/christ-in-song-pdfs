##THERE IS A FOUNTAIN
##(Fountain. C. M.)
. There  is a fountain fill'd with blood, 
Drawn  from Imman uel's  veins; 
And  sinners plung'd beneath that flood Lose  all their guilty stains. Lose  all their guilty stains,   Lose all their guilt y  stains. And  sinners plung'd beneath that flood Lose  all their guilty stains. 
2. The  dying thief rejoiced to see, 
That  fountain in  his  day; 
And  there may I, though vile as he, Wash  all my sins away. Wash  all my sins away,   Wash all my sins  away. And  there may 
I, though vile as he, Wash  all my sins away. 
3. Thou  dying Lamb! Thy precious blood 
Shall  never lose  its  pow'r, 
Till  all the ransomed 
Church of God Are  saved to sin no more. Are  saved to sin no more,   Are saved to sin no  more. Till  all the ransomed Church of 
God Are  saved to sin no more. 
4. E'er  since by faith I saw the stream 
Thy  flowing wounds  supply, 
Redeeming love has been my theme, And  shall be till 
I die. And  shall be till 
I die,   And shall be till  
I  die. Redeeming love has been my theme, And  shall be till 
I die. 
5. Lord,  I believe Thou hast prepared, 
Unworthy though I  be, 
For  me a bloodbought, free reward— Eternal life for me. Eternal life for me,   Eternal life  for  me. For  me a bloodbought, free reward— Eternal life for me. 
6. There  in a nobler, sweeter song, 
I'll  sing Thy pow'r  to  save, 
When  this poor lisping, stam'ring tongue Is  ransom'd from the grave. Is  ransom'd from the grave, Is ransom'd from  the  grave. When  this poor lisping, stam'ring tongue Is  ransom'd from the grave.
