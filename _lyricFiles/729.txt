##SAVIOUR, LIKE A SHEPHERD
##(Shepherd. 8s  7s.)
. Saviour, like a shepherd lead  us;  Much we need Thy tender care; In 
Thy pleasant pastures feed  us,  
For our use Thy fold prepare. 
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, 
Thou hast bought us, Thine we are; Blessed Jesus, blessed 
Jesus, Thou hast bought us, 
Thine we are. 
2. We are Thine, do 
Thou befriend  us,  Be the 
Guardian of our way; Keep 
Thy flock, from sin defend  us,  
Seek us when we go astray. 
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, 
Hear, O hear us, when we pray; Blessed Jesus, blessed 
Jesus, Hear, O hear us, when we pray. 
3. Thou hast promised to receive  us,  Poor and sinful tho' we be; Thou hast mercy to relieve  us,  
Grace to cleanse, and pow'r to free. 
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, 
We will early turn to 
Thee; Blessed Jesus, blessed 
Jesus, We will early turn to Thee.
