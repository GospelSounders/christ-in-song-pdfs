##BY THEE WE RISE
##(Vienna. 7s.)
. Christ is ris'n, our Lord  and led,â€” 
King, Let the whole creation sing; Raise your joys and triumphs  high; Sing, ye heav'ns, let earth reply. 
2. Vain the stone, the watch,  the  seal, Christ the mighty, to conceal; Death in vain forbids  Him rise, He hath opened paradise. 
3. Lead us, Lord, where Thou  hast   Thou, our High, exalted 
Head; Made like Thee, by 
Thee  we rise; Ours the cross, the grave, the skies.
