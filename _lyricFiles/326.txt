##SAVIOUR MINE
##(Savoy Chapel. 7s, 6s. D.)
. To Thee, O dear, dear 
Saviour! My spirit turns for rest, 
My peace is in Thy favor, 
My pillow on Thy breast;  
Tho' all theis world deceive me, 
I know that I am Thine, 
And Thou wilt never leave me, 
O blessed Saviour mine. 
2. In Thee my trust abideth, On Thee my hope relies, 
O Thou whose love provid eth 
For all beneath the skies;  
It was Thy mercy found me, 
From bondage set me free, 
And then for ever bound  me 
With threefold cords to 
Thee. 
3. My grief is in the dullness With which this sluggish heart 
Doth open to the full ness 
Of all Thou wouldst impart;  
My hope in Thy beauty 
Of holiness divine, 
My joy is in the du ty 
That binds my life in 
Thine. Amen.
