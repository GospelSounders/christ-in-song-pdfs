##NOT TRY, BUT TRUST
##E. G. Taylor, D. D.
##Geo. C. Stebbins
1. Not saved are we by trying, From self can come no aid; 
'Tis on the blood relying, Once for our ransom paid; 
'Tis looking unto Jesus, The holy One and just; 
'Tis  His great work that saves us, It is not try, but trust.

2. 'Twas vain for Israel bitten By serpents on their way, 
To look to their own doing, That awful plague to stay; 
The remedy and healing, When humbled in the dust, 
Was  of the Lord's revealing, It is not try, but trust.

3. No deeds of ours are needed To make Christ's merit more; 
No frames of mind, or feelings, Can add to His great store; 
'Tis simply to receive Him, The holy One and just, 
'Tis  only to believe Him, It is not Try, but Trust. 

CHORUS.
It is not Try, but Trust, 
It is not Try, but Trust; 
'Tis  His great work that saves us; 
It is not Try, but Trust.
