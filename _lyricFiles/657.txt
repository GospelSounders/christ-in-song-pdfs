##OUR BANNER
##(St. Gertrude. 6s, 5s. D.)
. Brightly gleams our ban ner, 
Pointing to the sky, Waving wand'rers onward, 
To their home on high; 
Journ'ying o'er the des ert, Gladly thus we pray, 
And with hearts uni ted,  
Take our heav'nward way. 
2. Jesus, Lord and Mas ter; 
At Thy sacred feet, Here with hearts rejoicing, 
See Thy children meet; 
Often have we left  
Thee, Often gone astray; 
Keep us, mighty Sav iour,  
In the narrow way. 
3. All our days direct  us 
In the way we go, Lead us on victorious, 
Over every foe, 
Bid Thine angels shield  us, When the stormclouds low'r, 
Pardon Thou, and save  us  
In the final hour. 
Brightly gleams our banner,  
Pointing to the  sky, Waving wand'rers onward, 
To their home on high.
