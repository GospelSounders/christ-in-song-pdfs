##MY SALVATION, MY ALL
##(Beloved. 11s  8s.)
. O Thou  in whose presenc e my soul takes delight, 
On whom in affliction 
I call, My comfort by day and my song in the night, My  hope, my salvation, my all! 
2. His voice,  as the sound  of the dulcimer sweet, 
Is heard thro' the shadows of death; The cedars of 
Lebanon bow at 
His feet, The  air  is perfum'd with 
His breath. 
3. His lips,  as a fount ain of righteousness flow, 
To water the gardens of grace; From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know, And  bask  in the smiles of 
His face. 
4. He looks,  and ten thou sands of angels rejoice, 
And myriads wait for 
His word; He speaks, and eternity, fill'd with 
His voice, Reech oes the praise of the Lord.
