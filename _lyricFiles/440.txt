##PRAISE FOR TRUTH
##(Hope. 8s  7s.)
. Praise to Him by whose  kind  favor 
Heav'nly truth  has reached our ears; 
May its sweet reviv ing  savor 
Fill our hearts  and calm our fears. 
2. Truth! how sacred is  the  treasure! 
Teach us, Lord,  its worth  to know; 
Vain the hope, and short  the  pleasure 
Which from oth er sourc es flow. 
3. What of truth we have  been  hearing, 
Fix, O Lord,  in ev 'ry heart; 
In the day of Thy  appearing 
May we share  Thy peo ple's part.
