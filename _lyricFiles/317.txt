##I LAY MY SINS ON JESUS
##(Norval. 7s, 6s. D.)
. I lay my sins on Jesus, 
The spotless Lamb of 
God; He bears them all, and frees us From the accursed load. 
I bring my guilt to 
Jesus, To wash the crimson stains 
White in His blood most precious, 
Till not one spot remains. 
2. I lay my wants on Je sus; 
All fullness dwells in 
Him; He heals all my diseas es, He doth my soul redeem: 
I lay my griefs on 
Je sus, My burdens and my cares, 
He from them all releas es, 
He all my sorrow shares. 
3. I long to be like Je sus, 
Meek, loving, lowly, mild; I long to be like 
Je sus, The Father's holy child: 
I long to be with 
Je sus Amid the heav'nly throng, 
To sing with them His prais es, 
To learn the angel's song.
