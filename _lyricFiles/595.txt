##THE HOUR OF PRAYER
##(Almsgiving. 8, 8, 8, 4)
. My God, is  any hour so sweet, 
From blush of morn   to eve ning star, As that which calls me to  
Thy feet, The  hour of pray'r? 
2. No words can,  tell  what sweet  relief 
Here for my ev  'ry want,  
I find; What strength for warfare, balm  for grief, What  peace of mind. 
3. Hush'd is each  doubt,  gone evry fear; 
My spirit seems   in heav'n  to stay; And e'en the peniten tial tear Is  wiped away. 
4. Lord, till I  reach  that bliss ful shore, 
No privilege   so dear  shall be As thus my inmost soul  to pour In  pray'r to 
Thee.
