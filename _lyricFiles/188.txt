##GOD SHALL BE FIRST
##(Lowry. L. M.)
. God shall be first in ev'rything; No other gods before  
Him; Creator and 
RedeemerKing, 
'Tis pleasure to adore  
Him. 
2. First when with rosy morn 
I wake,— His pow'r mine eyes unsealing; First when His bounteous gifts I take,— 
His Fatherlove revealing. 
3. First when the crowding cares of day Impatient press upon  me; First when the gentle twilight ray 
With peaceful calm falls on  me. 
4. First when I leave mortality, The glad new song upraising; First all Eternity, where we 
Shall dwell who here are praising.
