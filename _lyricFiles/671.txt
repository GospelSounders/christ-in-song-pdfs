##FRIEND UNSEEN
##(Flemming. 8, 8, 8, 6.)
. O Holy Saviour, 
Friend  unseen,  Since on 
Thine arm  Thou bidds't me  lean,  
Help me, thro'out  life's varying  scene,   By faith to cling to Thee. 
2. Blest with this fellowship Divine,  Take what 
Thou wilt,  I'll ne'er repine;  
E'en as the branch es to the  vine,   My soul would cling to Thee. 
3. What tho' the world deceitful  prove,  And earthly friends  and joys remove,  
With patient, un complaining  love   Still would 
I cling to Thee. 
4. Blest is my lot, whate'er  befall;  What can disturb  me, who appall,  
While as my strength, my 
Rock, my  All,   Saviour, 
I cling to Thee?
