###“...I am the way, the truth, and the life...” (John 14:6).
1. Like wand'ring sheep o'er mountains cold, 
Since all have gone astray;  
To "Life" and peace within the fold, 
How may I find the way?    

2. Bewildered oft with doubt and care, 
To God I fain would go; 
While many cry "Lo here! lo there!" 
The Truth how may I know?    

3. To Christ the Way, the Truth, the Life, 
I come, no more to roam;  
He'll guide me to my "Father's house," 
To my eternal home.    

CHORUS.
"I  am the way, the truth, and the life 
(I am the way, I am the way, I am the way, the truth and the life) 
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.  
"I  am the way, the truth, and the life 
(I am the way, I am the way, I am the way, the truth and the life) 
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me."
