##WHO ARE THESE?
##“...These are they which came out of great tribulation...” (Revelation 7:14).
. Who are these whose songs are sounding O'er the gold  en harps above? 
Hark! they tell of grace abounding, And 
Jehovah's sov'reign love. 
2. Who are these that keep their station Round the great   eternal throne? 
They from earthly tribulation To their heav'nly rest are gone. 
3. See their robes of dazzling whiteness, Without blemish, spot or stain; 
See their crowns that grow in brightness, Purchas'd by the Lamb once slain. 
4. 'Tis the Lamb of 
God who leads them, And they serve   Him night and day, 
By the heav'nly fount 
He leads them He hath wiped their tears away. 
5. Sweet the theme: 'tis still "salvation Unto 
Christ   the Holy One," 
And their sighs of tribulation Change to songs around the throne. 
These  are they  who wash'd their robes  and made  them white  in the blood of the 
Lamb,  These  are they  who wash'd their robes  and made  them white  in the blood of the 
Lamb.    These are they    who wash'd their robes  made  them and made them white      of the Lamb,    
These are they    who wash'd their robes     and made them white        ofthe Lamb.
