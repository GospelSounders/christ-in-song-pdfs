##LOOK FOR THE WAYMARKS
##“Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets” (Amos 3:7).
. Look for the waymarks as you journey on, 
Look for the waymarks, passing one by one; 
Down thro' the ages, past the kingdoms four,— 
Where are we standing? 
Look the waymarks o'er. 
2. First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world, 
Then MedoPersia's banners were unfurled; 
And after Greece held universal sway, 
Rome seized the scepter,— 
Where are we today? 
3. Down in the feet of iron and of clay, 
Weak and divided, soon to pass away; 
What will the next great, glorious drama be?— 
Christ and His coming, 
And eternity. 
Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic waymarks, 
Down thro' the ages, past the kingdoms four.  
Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic waymarks; 
The journey's almost o'er.
