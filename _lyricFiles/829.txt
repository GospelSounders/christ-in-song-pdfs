##STILL WITH THEE
##(Greenwood. S. M.)
. Still with Thee, O my 
God! I would desire to be; 
By day, by night, at home, abroad, 
I would  be still with 
Thee. 
2. With Thee when dawn comes in, And calls me back to care; 
Each day returning to begin 
With Thee,  my God, in pray'r. 
3. With Thee when day is done, And evening calms the mind; 
The setting, as the rising sun, 
With Thee  my heart would find. 
4. With Thee, in Thee, by faith Abiding I would be; 
By day, by night, in life, in death, 
I would  be still with 
Thee.
