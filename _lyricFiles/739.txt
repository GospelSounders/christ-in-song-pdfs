##KIND WORDS NEVER DIE
##Arr. by F. E. B.
. Kind words can never die; 
Cherish'd and blest: God knows how deep they lie, 
Stored in the breast, Like childhood's simple rhymes, 
Said o'er a thousand times,— 
Yes, in all years and climes, 
Distant or near. Kind words can never die, 
Never die, never die; Kind words can never die, 
No, never die. 
2. Sweet tho'ts can never die, 
Tho' like the flow'rs Their brightest hues may fly 
In wint'ry hours; But when the gentle dew 
Gives them their charms anew, 
With many an added hue 
They bloom again. Sweet tho'ts can never die, 
Never die, never die; Sweet tho'ts can never die, 
No, never die. 
3. True love can never die, 
Tho' in the tomb We all may silent lie, 
Wrapp'd in its gloom; Tho' mortal flesh decay, 
There comes a glorious day, 
When dust shall soar away 
To Christ above. True love can never die, 
Never die, never die; True love can never die, 
No, never die.
