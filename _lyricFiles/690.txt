##O LORD, OUR HEAVENLY KING
##(El Kader. S. M.)
. O Lord, our heavenly 
King, Thy name is all divine; Thy glories round the earth are spread, And o'er the heavens they shine. 
Thy glories round the earth are spread, 
And o'er the heavens they  shine. 
2. Lord, what is worthless man, That Thou shouldst love him so? Next to Thine angels he is placed, And lord of all below. 
Next to Thine angels he is placed, 
And lord of all below. 
3. How rich Thy bounties are, How wondrous are 
Thy ways! In us O let 
Thy power frame A monument of praise! 
In us O let Thy power frame 
A monument of  praise!
