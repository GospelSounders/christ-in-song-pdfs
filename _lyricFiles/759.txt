##HAPPY THE HOME
##(Warwick. C. M.)
. Happy  the  home when  God  is there, 
And love fills  ev 'ry  breast; 
When one  their  wish, and  one  their  prayer, And one  their  heav'nly rest. 
2. Happy  the  home where  Je sus' name 
Is sweet to ev 'ry  ear; 
Where chil dren  early  lisp  
His  fame, And par ents hold 
Him dear. 
3. Happy  the  home where  prayer  is heard, 
And praise is wont  to  rise; 
Where par ents love the  sa cred  word, And live  but  for the skies. 
4. Lord, may  we  in our  homes  agree, 
This blessed  peace  to  gain; 
Unite  our  hearts in  love  to  Thee, And love  to  all will reign.
