##SCATTER THE SEEDS OF KINDNESS
##“Be kindly affectioned one to another...” (Romans 12:10).
. Let us gather up the sunbeams, 
Lying all around our path; 
Let us keep the wheat and roses, 
Casting out the thorns and chaff; 
Let us find our sweetest comfort 
In the blessings of today, 
With a patient hand removing 
All the briers from the way. 
2. Strange we never prize the music 
Till the sweetvoiced bird is flown! 
Strange that we should slight the violets 
Till the lovely flow'rs are gone! 
Strange that summer skies and sunshine 
Never seem one half so fair 
As when winter's snowy pinions 
Shake the white down in the air. 
3. If we knew the baby fingers, 
Pressed against the window pane, 
Would be cold and stiff tomorrow— 
Never trouble us again— 
Would the bright eyes of our darling 
Catch the frown upon our brow? 
Would the prints of rosy fingers 
Vex us then as they do now? 
4. Ah! those little icecold fingers, 
How they point our mem'ries back 
To the hasty words and actions 
Strewn along our backward track! 
How those little hands remind us, 
As in snowy grace they lie, 
Not to scatter thorns— but roses— 
For our reaping by and by! 
Then scatter seeds of kindness, 
Then scatter seeds of kindness, 
Then scatter seeds of kindness, 
For our reaping by and by.
