##HALLELUJAHS TO JESUS
##J J
. Hallelujahs to Jesus! 
Hallelujahs forever! 
His  wondrous salva tion our tongues shall declare. 
Sound the life invitation, 
Call the glad coronation; 
The Lord of creation the crown shall wear. 
2. Strike the cymbals of glad ness, 
Hush the lone harps of sad ness; 
He  lives who redeemed  us from death's awful gloom. 
Tell the wonderful sto ry, 
From the manger to glo ry; 
All hail to King Je sus who burst  the tomb! 
3. With the angels unit ing, 
In His praises delight ing, 
Both  here and in heav'n  shall our joyanthem ring. 
For His love ever ver nal, 
For His mercy eter nal, 
Let glory super nal crown 
Je sus King.
