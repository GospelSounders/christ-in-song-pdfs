##COME AND WORSHIP
##1. An 2. Shep 3.
. Angels from the realms of glory, 
Wing your flight o'er all the earth, 
Ye who sang creation's story, 
Now proclaim Messiah's birth. 
2. Shepherds in the field abiding, 
Watching o'er your flocks by night, 
God with man is now residing, 
Yonder shines the  infant light. 
3. Sages, leave your contemplations, 
Brighter visions beam afar, 
Seek the great Desire of nations; 
Ye have seen His  natal star. 
4. Saints, before the altar bending, 
Watching long in hope and fear, 
Suddenly the Lord descending, 
In His temple  shall appear. 
Come and worship, come and worship, 
Worship Christ,  the  newborn  
King. 
(Last)Come and worship, come and worship, 
Worship Christ,  the  coming  
King.
