##CROWN HIM
##1. Come,
. Come, children, hail  the  
Prince of Peace,  Obey the 
Saviour's call; Come, seek 
His face  and  taste His grace,  And  crown Him  Lord of all. 
2. Ye lambs of Christ,  your  tribute bring, Ye  children, great and small; Hosanna sing  to  Christ your 
King,  And  crown Him  Lord of all. 
3. This Jesus will  your  sins forgive,  O  haste! be fore Him fall; For you 
He died,  that  you might live  To  crown Him  Lord of all. 
In the dewy time of youth, let us come, 
Before the brown leaves fall; 
He will guide us with His truth, let us come, 
And crown  Him  Lord of all.
