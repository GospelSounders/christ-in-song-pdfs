##THE SPREADING GOSPEL
##(Germany. L. M.)
.The heav'ns declare 
Thy glo ry, Lord, 
In ev'ry star Thy wisdom shines, 
But viewing Christ  within Thy word,  We read 
Thy love  in clearer lines. 
2.The rolling sun, the chang ing light, 
And nights and days, Thy pow'r   confess; 
But the blest volume 
Thou didst write,  Reveals 
Thy jus tice and  Thy grace. 
3.Wide be Thy spreading gos pel preached 
Till thro' the world Thy truth has run, 
Till Christ has all  the nations reached, That see the light,  or feel  the sun. 
4.Great Sun of Righteousness,  arise; 
Bless the dark world with heav'n  ly light; 
Thy gospel makes  the simple wise,  Thy laws are pure,  Thy judg ments right.
