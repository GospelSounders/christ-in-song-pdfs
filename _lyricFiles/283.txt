##JESUS LOVES ME
##Anna Warner
. Jesus loves me! this 
I know, For the 
Bible tells me so; 
Little ones to Him belong, 
They are weak, but He is strong. 
2. Jesus loves me! He who died, Heaven's gate to open wide; 
He will wash away my sin. 
Let His little child come in. 
3. Jesus loves me! loves me still, When I'm sad or weak or ill; 
From His shining throne on high, 
Comes to watch me where 
I lie. 
4. Jesus loves me; He will stay, Close beside me all the way, 
If I love Him, by and by 
He will take me home on high. Yes, Jesus loves me, 
Yes, Jesus loves me; Yes, 
Jesus loves me, The Bible tells me so.
