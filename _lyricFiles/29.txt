##RING THE BELLS OF HEAVEN

###“...Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth...” (Luke 15:7).
1. Ring the bells of heaven! there is joy today. 
For a soul, returning from the wild; 
See! the Father meets him out upon the way, 
Welcoming His weary, wand'ring child. 

2. Ring the bells of heaven! there is joy today. 
For the wanderer now is reconciled; 
Yes, a soul is rescued from his sinful way, 
And is born anew a ransomed child. 

3. Ring the bells of heaven! spread the feast today, 
Angels swell the glad triumphant strain. 
Tell the joyful tidings! bear it far away! 
For a precious soul is born again. 

CHORUS.
Glory! glory! how the angels sing; 
Glory! glory! how the loud harps ring; 
'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea, 
Pealing forth the anthem of the free.
