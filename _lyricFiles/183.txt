##A HEART OF PRAISE
##(Beatitudo. C. M.)
. Oh, for a heart to praise  my God! A heart from sin setd free,   that always feels 
Thy blood, So freely shed for me. 
2. A heart resigned, submis sive, meek, My dear 
Redeemer's throne,   ly Christ is heard to speak, Where Jesus reigns alone. 
3. A heart in ev'ry tho't  renewed, And full of love  vine,   and right, and pure, and good, A copy, 
Lord, of Thine. 
4. Thy nature, gracious 
Lord, impart; Come quickly from above:   new name upon my heart, Thy new, best name of Love.
