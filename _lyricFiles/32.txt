###“...Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock” (Matthew 7:24-25).
1. We'll build on the Rock, the living Rock, On Jesus, the Rock of Ages; 
So shall we abide the fear ful shock, When loud the tempest rages. 

2. Some build on the sinking sands  of life, On visions of earthly treasure; 
Some build on the waves of sin  and strife, Of fame, and worldly pleasure.

3. O build on the Rock, for ever sure, The firm and the true foundation; 
Its hope is the hope which shall  endure,— The hope of our salvation. 

CHORUS.
We'll  build  on the Rock (We'll  build on the Rock, on the solid Rock),   
We'll  build    on the Rock(We'll  build on the Rock, on the solid Rock),  
We'll  build on the Rock, on the solid Rock, 
On Christ, the mighty Rock.
