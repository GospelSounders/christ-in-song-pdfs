##AT THE CROSS
##“Look unto me, and be ye saved...” (Isaiah 45:22).
. Alas! and did my 
Saviour bleed, And did my 
Sov'reign die? Would 
He devote that sacred head 
For such a worm as I? 
2. Was it for deeds that 
I have done, He groaned upon the tree? Amazing pity, grace unknown, 
And love beyond degree! 
3. But drops of grief can ne'er repay The debt of love I owe; Here, 
Lord, I give myself away, 
'Tis all that I can do! 
At the cross, at the cross, where 
I first  saw the light, 
And the burden of my heart rolled away, 
It was there by faith I received my  sight, 
And now I am happy all the day.
