##HOW SWEET THE NAME!
##(Howard. C. M.)
. How  sweet the name of Je sus sounds  In a believer's ear! 
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,  And drives a way his fear. 
2. It  makes the wounded spir it whole,  And calms the trou bled breast; 
'Tis manna to the hun gry soul, 
And  to   the wea  ry, rest. 
3. Dear  name! the rock on which  
I build!  My shield and hid ingplace! 
My neverfail ing treas 'ry, filled 
With  bound  less stores   of grace!
