##THE HANDWRITING ON THE WALL

###“In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king’s palace...” (Daniel 5:5).
1.  At the feast of Belshazzar and a thousand of his lords, 
While they drank from golden vessels, as the Book of Truth records, 
In the night as they reveled in the royal palace hall, 
They were seiz'd with consternation, at the hand upon the wall. 

2. See the brave captive Daniel as he stood before the throng, 
And rebuked the haughty monarch for his mighty deeds of wrong; 
As he read out the writing, t'was the doom of one and all; 
For the kingdom now "is finished," said the hand upon the wall. 

3. See the faith, zeal, and courage that would dare to do the right, 
Which the Spirit gave to Daniel this the secret of his might; 
In his home in Judea, or a captive in the hall, 
Yet he understood the writing of his God upon the wall. 

4. All our deeds are recorded; there's a Hand that's writing now; 
Sinner, give your heart to Jesus, to His royal mandate bow; 
For the day is approaching, it must come to one and all, 
When the sinner's condemnation will be written on the wall. 

CHORUS.
'Tis the hand of God on the wall(the palace wall),     
'Tis the hand of God on the wall (the palace wall).  
Shall the record be "Found wanting," 
Or shall it be "Found trusting," 
While the hand is writing on the wall? (the palace wall)
