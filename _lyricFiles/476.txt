##I LOVE TO TELL THE STORY
##â€œFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
. I love to tell the story 
Of unseen things  above; 
Of Jesus and His glory, 
Of  Jesus and  His love; 
I love to tell the story, 
Because I know 'tis  true, 
It satisfies my longing 
As nothing else can do. 
2. I love to tell the sto ry; 
More wonderful it seems 
Than all the golden fancies 
Of  all our gold en dreams; 
I love to tell the story, 
It did so much for  me, 
And that is just the reason 
I tell it now to thee. 
3. I love to tell the sto ry; 
'Tis pleasant to  repeat 
What seems each time I tell it, 
More  wonderful ly sweet; 
I love to tell the story, 
For some have never  heard 
The message of salvation 
From God's own holy word. 
4. I love to tell the sto ry; 
For those who know it best 
Seem hungering and thirsting 
To  hear it like  the rest; 
And when in scenes of glory 
I sing the new, new  song, 
'Twill be the old, old story 
That I have loved so long. 
I love to tell the story; 
'Twill be my theme in glory 
To tell the old,  old story 
Of Jesus and His love.
