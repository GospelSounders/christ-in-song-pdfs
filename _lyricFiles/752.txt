##SOLDIERS OF CHRIST, ARISE!
##(Silver Street. S. M.)
. Soldiers of Christ, arise, 
And put your armor  on; 
Fight, for the battle will  be   ours; We fight   to win a  crown. 
2. We fight not against flesh, 
We wrestle not  with  blood; 
But principalities  and   pow'rs, And for   the truth of  
God; 
3. With wicked spirits, too, 
That in high pla ces  stand, 
Perverting oft the word  of   
God, And say   'tis by command.
