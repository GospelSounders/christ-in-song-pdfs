##HE BROUGHT ME OUT
##“He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock...” (Psalm 40:2).
. My heart was distress'd 'neath 
Jehovah's dread frown, 
And low in the pit where my sins dragg'd me down; 
I cried to the Lord from the deep miry clay, 
Who tenderly brought me out to golden day. 
2. He placed me upon the strong Rock by His side, 
My steps were established and here I'll abide; 
No danger of falling while here I remain, 
But stand by His grace until the crown 
I gain. 
3. He gave me a song, 'twas a new song of praise. 
By day and by night its sweet notes I will raise; 
My heart's overflowing, 
I'm happy and free, 
I'll praise my Redeemer, who has rescued me. 
4. I'll sing of His wonderful mercy to me, 
I'll praise Him till all men 
His goodness shall see; 
I'll sing of salvation at home and abroad, 
Till many shall hear the truth and trust in God. He brought me out of the miry clay, 
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;  
He puts a song in my soul today, 
A song of praise, hallelujah!
