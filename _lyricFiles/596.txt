##BUY UP THE OPPORTUNITY
##Ephesians 5:16
. Buy up the opportunity, 
O Christian, buy today; 
For Heaven's ageless mansions buy, 
Buy treasures while you may. 
2. Buy up the opportunity, 
It may not long remain; 
The evil hosts are bidding, too, 
Those precious souls to gain. 
3. Buy up the opportunity, 
Pay any price to win; 
With Heaven's legions watching you, 
To falter will be sin. 
4. Buy up the opportunity, 
At home; in lands afar; 
Go quickly! Find the jewels rare,â€” 
Each soul a glowing star. 
Buy up the opportunity, 
The souls for whom Christ died, 
Buy up the opportunity, 
Buy for the Crucified.
