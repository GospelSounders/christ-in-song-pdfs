##GO TO DARK GETHSEMANE
##(Spanish Hymn. 7s. 6L.)
. Go to dark Gethsemane, 
Ye that feel the tempter's power; 
Your Redeemer's conflict see, 
Watch with Him one bitter hour; 
Turn not from His griefs away; Learn of Jesus how to pray. 
2. Follow to the judgmenthall; 
View the Lord of life arraigned; 
See the wormwood and the gall; 
See the pangs His soul sustained; 
Shun not suffering, shame, or loss; Learn of Him to bear the cross. 
3. Calvary's mournful mountain climb; 
There, adoring at His feet, 
Mark that miracle of time, 
God's own sacrifice complete: 
"It is finished! " hear 
Him cry; Learn of Jesus how to die.
