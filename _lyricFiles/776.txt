##IN THE MORNING
##(Mear. C. M.)
. Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear My voice ascending high; 
To Thee will I direct my prayer, 
To Thee lift up mine eyeâ€” 
2. O may Thy Spirit guide my feet In ways of righteousness! 
Make ev'ry path of duty straight 
And plain before my face. 
3. The men that love and fear 
Thy name Shall see their hopes fulfilled; 
The mighty God will compass them 
With favor as a shield.
