##THE HELPING WORD
##“Bear ye one another’s burdens...” (Galatians 6:2).
. If any little word of mine 
May make a dark life brighter, 
If any little song of mine 
May make a sad heart 
2. If any little love of mine 
May make a hard life sweeter, 
If any little care of mine 
May make a friend's the 
3. If any little lift of mine 
May ease a toiler bending, 
God give me love and care and strength; 
We live for Him by fleeter. 
God help me speak the helping word, 
And sweeten it with singing, 
And drop it in some lonely vale, 
To set the echoes ringing.
