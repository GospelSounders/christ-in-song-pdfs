##NEVER GIVE UP
##“...We are not of them who draw back...” (Hebrews 10:39).
. Never be sad or desponding, 
Only have faith to believe;  Grace, for the duties before thee, Ask of thy 
God and receive.  
2. What if thy burdens oppress thee? 
What tho' thy life may be drear?  Look on the side that is brightest, Pray, and thy path will be clear.  
3. Never be sad or desponding, 
Lean on the arm of thy 
Lord;  Dwell in the depths of 
His mercy, Thou shalt receive thy reward.  Nev er give up,  nev er give up,  Nev ergive up,   nev ergive up, 
Nev ergive up,   nev ergive up, 
Never give up to thy sorrows, 
Jesus will bid them depart;  
Trust  in the Lord,  
Trust  in the Lord,  
Trust in the Lord,   trust in the Lord, 
Trust in the Lord,   trust in the Lord, 
Sing when your trials are greatest, 
Trust in the Lord and take heart.
