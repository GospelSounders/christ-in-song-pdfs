##ETERNAL DEPTH OF LOVE
##(Rothwell. L. M.)
. Eternal depth of love divine, 
In Jesus, God with us,  displayed, 
How bright Thy beaming glories shine!  
How wide Thy heal ing  streams are spread, How wide  
Thy healing  streams are spread! 
2. With whom dost Thou delight to dwell? 
Sinners, a vile and thankless race! 
O God, what tongue aright  can tell  
How vast Thy love,  how  great Thy grace? How vast  
Thy love, how  great Thy grace? 
3. The dictates of Thy sov 'reign will 
With joy our grateful hearts  receive; 
All Thy delight in us  fulfill:  
Lo! all we are,  to  
Thee we give; Lo! all  we are, to  Thee we give. 
4. To Thy sure love, Thy ten der care, 
Our flesh, soul, spirit, we resign; 
O, fix Thy sacred presence there,  
And seal th' abode  forever Thine! And seal  th' abode forever 
Thine!
