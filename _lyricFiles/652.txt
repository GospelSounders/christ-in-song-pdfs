##PILOT ME
##(Gould. 7s. 6L.)
. Jesus, Saviour, pi lot me 
Over life's tempestuous sea; 
Unknown waves before me roll,   Hiding rock anding treach'rous shoal;   Chart and compass come  from Thee; 
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me. 
2. As a mother stills  her child, 
Thou canst calm the ocean wild; 
Boist'rous waves obey 
Thy will When Thou sayest to them, 
"Be still! "  Wond'rous 
Sov'reign of  the sea, 
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me. 
3. When at last I near  the shore, 
And the fearful breakers roar 
'Tween me and the peaceful rest,   Then, while lean on 
Thy breast,   May I hear Thee say  to me, 
"Fear not, I will pilot thee."
