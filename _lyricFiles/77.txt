##LIKE AS A FATHER
##F. E. Belden

##(Psalm 103:13)
1. Like as a father pities his child, 
So the Lord pities the sinner defiled; 
Waiteth in kindness, Pities our blindness, 
Longeth to welcome, tho' often reviled. 

2. Like as a father when we believe, 
Merciful Saviour, He waits to receive; 
Listens to hear us, Blesses to cheer us, 
Pities whenever His Spirit we grieve. 

3. Like as a father, ever the same, 
He hath created, and knoweth our frame; 
Watcheth the straying, Guardeth the praying, 
Bids us to trust in His Almighty name. 

4. Like as a father, constant is He, 
God in compassion regardeth our plea; 
In need He cometh, Precious His promise: 
Father in heaven for ever to be.
