##Iâ€™LL LIVE FOR HIM
##J
. My life, my love, I give to Thee, Thou Lamb of 
God, who died for me; 
O, may I ever faithful be, My Saviour and my God! 
2. I now believe Thou dost receive, For Thou hast died that I might live, 
And now henceforth I'll trust in 
Thee, My Saviour and my God! 
3. O Thou who died on 
Calvary, To save my soul and make me free, 
I consecrate my life to 
Thee, My Saviour and my God! 
I'll live for Him who died for me; 
How happy then my life shall be! 
I'll live for Him who died for me, 
My Saviour and my God!
