##TO-DAY THE SAVIOUR CALLS
##(To-day. 6s  4s.)
. Today the Saviour calls; 
Ye wand'rers, come; 
O ye benighted souls, 
Why longer roam? 
2. Today the Saviour calls; 
Oh, hear Him now; 
Within these sacred walls 
To Jesus bow. 
3. Today the Saviour calls; 
For refuge fly; 
The storm of justice falls, 
And death is nigh. 
4. The Spirit calls today; 
Yield to His pow'r, 
Oh, grieve Him not away, 
'Tis mercy's hour.
