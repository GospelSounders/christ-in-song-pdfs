##HIS EXAMPLE
##(Shining Shore. 8s. 7s. P.)
. This rite our blest Redeemer gave 
To all in Him believing; 
He bids us seek this hallowed grave, 
To His example cleaving. 
2. For me the cross and shame to bear, 
Dear Saviour, Thou wast willing; 
Nor would I shrink 
Thy yoke to wear, 
All righteousness fulfilling. 
3. Jesus to Thee we yield our all; 
In Thy kind arms enfold us; 
Our hearts are fixed,â€” no fears appall, 
Thy gracious pow'r shall hold us. 
I'll follow now my glorious 
Lord, Whate'er the ties I sever; 
He saves my soul, He's left 
His word To guide me now and ever.
