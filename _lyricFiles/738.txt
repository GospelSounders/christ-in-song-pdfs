##â€™MID PLEASURES AND PALACES
##John Howard Payne
. 'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam, 
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home! 
A charm  from the skies seems to hal low us there, 
Which, seek through  the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.      
2. An exile from home, splendor daz zles in vain, 
O  give me my lowly thatched cot tage again; 
The birds  singing gaily, that come  at my call, 
And with  them, 
God's peace, which is dear er than all. 
Home, home,  sweet, sweet home; 
Be it ever so humble there's no  place like home.
