##THE CALL FOR REAPERS
##“...The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few” (Matthew 9:37).
. Far and near  the fields are teeming 
With the sheaves of rip ened grain; 
Far and near  their gold is gleaming 
O'er the sun ny slope and plain. 
2. Send them forth  with morn's first beam ing, 
Send them in the noon tide's glare; 
When the sun's  last rays are stream ing, 
Bid them gath er ev'rywhere. 
3. O thou whom  thy Lord is send ing, 
Gather now the sheaves  of gold, 
Heav'nward then  at evening wend ing 
Thou shalt come  with joy untold. 
Lord of harvest, send forth reapers! 
Hear us,  Lord, to Thee  we cry; 
Send them now  the sheaves to gather, 
Ere the harvest time pass by.
