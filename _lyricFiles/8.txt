###“...The Master...calleth for thee” (John 11:28).
1. Jesus is tenderly calling thee home— 
Calling today, calling today; 
Why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam 
Farther and farther away?  

2. Jesus is calling the weary to rest— 
Calling today, calling today; 
Bring Him thy burden, and thou shalt be blest; 
He will not turn thee away.  

3. Jesus is waiting, oh, come to Him now— 
Waiting today, waiting today; 
Come with thy sins, at His feet lowly bow; 
Come, and no longer delay.  

4. Jesus is pleading, oh, list to His voice— 
Hear Him today, hear Him today; 
They who believe on His name shall rejoice; 
Quickly arise and away.  

REFRAIN.
Calling today; (Calling, calling today today); 
Calling today; (Calling, calling today today);
Jesus is calling (Jesus is tenderly calling today), is tenderly calling today.
