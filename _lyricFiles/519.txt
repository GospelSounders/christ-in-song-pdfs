##’TIS SO SWEET TO TRUST IN JESUS
##“...He shall...save them, because they trust in him” (Psalm 37:40).
. 'Tis so sweet to trust in 
Jesus, Just to take 
Him at His word; 
Just to rest upon 
His promise; Just to know, 
"Thus saith the Lord." 
2. O how sweet to trust in 
Jesus, Just to trust 
His cleansing blood; 
Just in simple faith to plunge me 'Neath the healing, cleansing flood. 
3. Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in 
Jesus, Just from sin and self to cease; 
Just from Jesus simply taking Life, and rest, and joy, and peace. 
4. I'm so glad I learn'd to trust Thee, Precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend; 
And I know that Thou art with me, Wilt be with me till the end. Jesus, 
Jesus, how I trust Him; 
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er! 
Jesus, Jesus, precious 
Jesus! O for grace to trust 
Him more!
