##OUTSIDE THE DOOR
##(St. Hilda. 7s  6s. D.)
. O Jesus!  Thou art standing 
Outside the  fastclosed door, 
In lowly  patience waiting 
To pass the  threshold  o'er: 
We bear the name of 
Christians, Thy name and  sign we  bear: 
O, shame, thrice shame upon us! 
To keep Thee standing  there. 
2. O Jesus!  Thou art knocking; 
And lo! that hand is scarred, 
And thorns Thy brow encircle, 
And tears Thy face have  marred: 
O, love that passeth knowledge, So patient ly to  wait! 
O, sin that  hath no  equal, 
So fast to bar the  gate! 
3. O Jesus!  Thou art pleading 
In accents  meek and low,â€” 
"I died for  you, My children, 
And will ye  treat Me  so?" 
O Lord, with shame and sorrow We open  now the  door: 
Dear Saviour,  quickly  enter, 
And leave us nevermore!
