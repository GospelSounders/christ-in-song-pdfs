##THE SOLID ROCK
##(L. M. 6L.)
. My hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus' blood and righteousness; 
I dare not trust the sweetest frame, 
But wholly lean on Jesus' name. 
2. When darkness seems to veil 
His face, I rest on 
His unchanging grace; 
In ev'ry high and stormy gale, 
My anchor holds within the vail. 
3. His oath, His covenant, and blood, Support me in the whelming flood; 
When all around my soul gives way, 
He then is all my hope and stay. 
4. When He shall come with trumpet sound, O may I then in Him be found; 
Clad in His righteousness alone, 
Faultless to stand before the throne. 
On Christ, the solid Rock, 
I stand; All other ground is sinking sand, 
All other ground is sinking sand.
