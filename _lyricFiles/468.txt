##(“Mount Olive.”)
Blessed are the poor in spir it: fortheirs is the kingdom of heav'n. 
Blessed are they that mourn: for rethey shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 
Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness: for  they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain   mercy. 
Blessed are the pure in heart: for  they shall see 
God. Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called  God's children. 
Blessed are they which are persecuted for  righteousness' sake. Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and speak all manner of evil against you, falsely for 
My   sake. 
Rejoice and be exceeding glad, your  ward is in heav'n.
