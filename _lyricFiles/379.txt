##SALVATION FREE
##(No Sorrow. S. M.)
. Come, ye  that love  the 
Lord, And let your joys be known; Join in a song  with sweet accord,  
And thus surround  the throne. 
2. Let those  refuse  to sing Who nev er knew our 
God; But ser vants of  the heav'nly King  
May speak their joys  abroad. 
3. Then let our songs  abound, And ev 'ry tear be dry; We're march ing thro'  
Immanuel's ground  
To fair er worlds on high. 
I'm glad  salvation's free, 
I'm glad  salvation's free; 
Salvation's free  for you and me;  
I'm glad  salvation's free.
