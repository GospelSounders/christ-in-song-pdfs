##THE TEMPERANCE CALL
##“...Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things” (I Corinthians 9:25).
Hear . the temp'rance call, 
Freemen one and all, 
Hear your country's earnest cry; 
See your native land 
Lift her beck'ning hand;— 
Sons of freedom, come ye nigh. Leave 2. the shop and farm, 
Leave your bright hearths warm; 
Work and pray the lost to save; 
Let your leaders be 
True and noble, free, 
Fearless, temp'rate, good, and brave. Hail! 3. our Fatherland, 
Here thy children stand, 
All resolv'd, united, true; 
In the temp'rance cause 
Ne'er to faint or pause! 
This our purpose is, and vow. 
Starve the monster from our shore, 
Let his cruel reign be o'er; 
Starve the monster from our shore, 
Let his cruel reign be o'er.
