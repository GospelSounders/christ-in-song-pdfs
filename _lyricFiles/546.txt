##MISSIONARY’S FAREWELL
##“...Come over into Macedonia, and help us” (Acts 16:9).
. On the shore beyond the sea, 
Where the fields  are bright and fair, There's a call,  a plaintive plea, 
I must hast en to be there. 
2. Hark! I hear the Master say, 
"Up, ye reap ers! why so slow?" To the vine yard, far away, 
Earthly kin dred, let me go. 
3. Just beyond  the rolling tide, 
The uplift ed hand 
I see; Lo! the gates  are open wide, 
And the lost  are calling me. 
4. Father, moth er, darling child, 
I must bid  you all adieu; Far across  the waters wild, 
There's a work  for me to do. 
Let me go,     
I cannot stay,  'Tis the 
Master calling me; 
Let me go,     I must obey;  
Native land,     farewell to thee.
