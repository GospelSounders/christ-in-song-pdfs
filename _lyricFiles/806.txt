##THY WILL BE DONE
##(Fern Dell. 8s. 7s.)
Je .sus, while our hearts are bleeding, 
O'er the spoils that death has won, We would at this solemn meeting, Calmly  say, "Thy will be  done." Tho' 2. cast down, we're not forsaken; 
Tho' afflicted, not alone; Thou didst give, and 
Thou hast taken; Blessed  
Lord, Thy will be  done. By 3. Thy hands the boon was given; 
Thou hast taken but 
Thine own; Lord of earth, and 
God of heaven, Evermore, Thy will be  done.
