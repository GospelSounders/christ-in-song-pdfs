##NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD

1. What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
What can make me pure within? Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

2. For my cleansing this I see— Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
For my pardon this my plea— Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 

3. Nothing can for sin atone— Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
Naught of good that I have done— Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 

4. This is all my hope and peace— Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
This is all my righteousness— Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 

5. Glory! glory! thus I sing— Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
All my praise for this I bring— Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 

REFRAIN.
Oh, precious is the flow 
That makes me white as snow;  
No other fount I know, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
