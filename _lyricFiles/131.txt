##NOTHING BUT LEAVES
##L. E. A.
. Nothing but leaves! The 
Spirit grieves O'er years of wasted life;  
O'er sins indulged while conscience slept, 
O'er vows and promises unkept, 
And reap from years of strife—  
2. Nothing but leaves! No gathered sheaves Of life's fair ripening grain;  
We sow our seeds; lo! tares and weeds,— 
Words, idle words, for earnest deeds,— 
Then reap, with toil  and pain,  
3. Nothing but leaves! Sad mem'ry weaves No vail to hide the past;  
And as we trace our weary way, 
And count each lost and misspent day, 
We sadly find  at last—  
4. Ah, who shall thus The 
Master meet, And bring but withered leaves?  
Ah, who shall at the 
Saviour's feet, 
Before the awful judgment seat 
Lay down for gold en sheaves,  
Nothing but leaves!  Nothing but leaves!
