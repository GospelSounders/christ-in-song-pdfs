##HEâ€™S COMING
##Anon.
. How we'll sweet are the tidings that greet the pilgrim's ear, 
As he wanders in exile from home! 
Soon,  soon will the 
Saviour in glory apshall pear, 
And a soon will the kingdom we'll come. 
2. The  mossy old graves where the pilgrims  sleep 
Shall be open'd as wide as before, 
And the millions that sleep in the mighty  deep 
Shall  live on this earth once  more. 
3. There  meet ne'er to part in our happy Eden home, 
Sweet  songs of redemption we'll sing; 
From  the North, from the South, all the ransom'd  come, 
And  worship our heavenly  
King. 
4. Hallelujah, Amen! 
Hallelujah again! 
Soon, if faithful, we all shall be there; 
O, be watchful, be hopeful, be joy ful till then, 
And  crown of bright glory  wear. He's coming, coming,  coming soon, 
I know, Coming back to this earth again; 
And the weary pilgrims will to glory go, 
When the Saviour  comes to  reign.
