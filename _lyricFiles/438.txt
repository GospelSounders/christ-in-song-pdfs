##LORD, DISMISS US
##(Sicily. 8s  7s.)
. Lord, dismiss  us  with 
Thy blessened, ing, 
Fill our hearts with  joy and peace; Let us each  
Thy  love possessing, 
Triumph in redeeming grace. 
O  re fresh us, O  re fresh us, Trav'ling  thro'  this  wilderness! 
2. Thanks we give,  and  adora tion, 
For Thy gospel's  joyful sound; May the fruits  of  Thy salva tion 
In our hearts and  lives abound; 
Ever  faithful, ever  faithful, To  Thy  truth  may  we be found. 
3. While our days  on  earth are length
May we give them,  Lord, to 
Thee; Cheered by hope,  and  daily strength ened, 
May we run, nor  weary be. 
Till  Thy glory, till  
Thy glory With out  clouds  in  heav'n we see.
