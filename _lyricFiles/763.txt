##HEAVENLY DOVE
##(St. Martinâ€™s. C. M.)
. Come, Ho  ly Spir  it,  heav'nly 
Dove, With all   Thy quick'ning pow'rs; 
Kindle a flame  of  sacred love 
In these  cold hearts of ours. 
2. O raise   our thoughts   from  things  below, From van  ities  and toys! 
Then  shall we with  fresh  cour age go 
To reach  eter nal joys. 
3. Awake   our souls   to  joyful songs; Let pure devo tions rise; 
Till  praise employs  our  thank ful tongues, 
And doubt forev er dies.
