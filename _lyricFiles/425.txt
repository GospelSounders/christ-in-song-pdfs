##COMING SAVIOUR
##(Holley. 7s.)
. Coming  Saviour, now in  faith We remember  still  
Thy  death; Thou wast broken— 
Thou hast  died; For us 
Thou wast crucified. 
2. While in  faith we drink  the  wine, Of Thy  blood we  see  the  sign; Wash us pure from ev 'ry  stain, Thou that comest soon to reign. 
3. Lord, we  thus remem ber  
Thee, But we  long Thy  face  to  see— Long to reach our heav'n ly  home; Come, Lord 
Jesus, quickly come!
