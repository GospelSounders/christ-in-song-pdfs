##JESUS, LOVER OF MY SOUL
##(“Refuge.” 7s. D.)
. Jesus, lover of my soul,  Let  me to 
Thy bosom fly, While the billows  near  me roll,  
While the tem pest  still  is high! 
Hide me, O my Sav iour hide,  Till the storm of life is past; Safe into the ha 
Iven  guide;  Oh, receive my soul at last! 
2. Other refuge have I none;  Hangs  my helpless soul on Thee; Leave, 
O leave  me  not  alone,  
Still support  and  com fort me. 
All my trust on Thee is stay'd,  All my help from 
Thee I bring; Cover my defence less head  With the shadow of 
Thy wing. 
3. Thou, O Christ, art all I want,  More  than all in Thee I find: Raise the fall en,  cheer the faint,  
Heal the sick  and lead  the blind. 
Just and holy is  
Thy name;  I am all unrighteousness; Vile and full of sin   am;  Thou art full of truth and grace. 
4. Plenteous grace with 
Thee is found,  Grace  to cover all my sin; Let the heal ing  streams  abound;  
Make and keep  me  pure  within. 
Thou of life the fount ain art,  Freely let me take of Thee; Spring 
Thou up within  my heart,  Rise to all eternity!
