##WELCOME HERE
##F. J. E.  F. E. B.
. Children singing, sweet bells ringing! 
Welcome, welcome, happy day! 
Pray'rs of thousands now are winging 
Up to heav'n their silent way. 
2. 'Tis an hour of happy meeting, 
We have met for praise and pray'r; 
But the hour is short and fleeting; 
This is why we're early here. 
3. We'll not keep our teachers waiting, 
While we tarry by the way, 
Nor disturb the school reciting,â€” 
'Tis the holy Sabbath day. 
Welcome, welcome, joyous welcome; 
Teachers, scholars, welcome here!
