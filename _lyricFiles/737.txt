##HOME, SWEET HOME
##David Denham
. 'Mid scenes of confusion and creature complaints, How sweet to my soul is commun ion of saints; 
To find  at the banquet of mer cy there's room, 
And feel in the presence of 
Jesus at home. 
2. Sweet bonds that unite all the chil dren of peace, And thrice precious 
Jesus, whose love  can not cease! 
Tho' oft  from the presence in sad ness I roam, 
By faith  I behold Thee in glo ry at home. 
3. While here in this valley of con flict 
I stay, O give me submission and strength  as my day; 
In all  my afflictions to 
Thee  I would come, 
Rejoic ing in hope of my glo rious home.      Home, home,  sweet, sweet home; 
Prepare  me, dear Saviour, for heaven my home.
