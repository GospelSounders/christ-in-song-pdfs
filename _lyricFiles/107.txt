1. I  hear the Saviour say, "Thy strength indeed is small; 
Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all." 

2. Lord,  now indeed I find Thy pow'r, and Thine alone, 
Can  change the leper's spots, And  melt the heart of stone. 

3. Since  nothing good have I Whereby Thy grace to claim, 
I'll  wash my garments white In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb. 


4. And  when before the throne I stand in Him complete, 
I'll  lay my trophies down, All  down at Jesus' feet. 

REFRAIN.
Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; 
Sin had left a crimson stain: He washed it white as snow.
