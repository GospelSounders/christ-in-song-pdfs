###“...This my son was dead, and is alive again...” (Luke 15:24).

1. In the land of strangers, Whither thou art gone, 
Hear a far voice calling, "My son! my son!"

2. "From the land of hunger, Fainting, famished, lone, 
Come to love and gladness, My son! my son! 

3. "Leave the haunts of riot, Wasted, woebegone, 
Sick at heart and weary, My son! my son!

4. "See the door still open! Thou art still My own; 
Eyes of love are on thee, My son! my son!

5. "Far off thou hast wandered; Wilt thou farther roam? 
Come, and all is pardoned, My son! my son! 

6. "See the wellspread table, Unforgotten one! 
Here is rest and plenty, My son! my son! 

7. "Thou art friendless, homeless, Hopeless, and undone; 
Mine is love unchanging, My son! my son! " 

CHORUS.
"Welcome! wand'rer, welcome! Welcome back to home! 
Thou hast wandered far away: Come home! come home! "
