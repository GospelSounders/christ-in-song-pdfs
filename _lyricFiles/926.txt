##THY KINGDOM COME
##(Andre. L. M.)
. Thy kingdom come. Thus day by  day We lift our hands to 
God and  pray; But who has ever duly weighed 
The meaning of the words 
He said? The meaning of the words 
He said? 
2. Thy kingdom come. O day  of  joy, When praise shall every tongue  em ploy; When hate and strife and war shall cease, 
And man with man shall be at peace, And man with man shall be at peace. 
3. Jesus shall reign on 
Zi on's  hill, And all the earth with glory  fill; His word shall 
Paradise restore, 
And sin and death afflict no more, And sin and death afflict no more.
