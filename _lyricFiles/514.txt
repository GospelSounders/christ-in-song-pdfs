##A CHILD OF THE KING
##“...Heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ...” (Romans 8:17).
. My Father is rich cast, in houses and lands, 
He holdeth the wealth of the world in 
His hands! Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold, His  coffers are full,— sion, He has riches untold. 
2. My Father's own Son,  the Saviour of men, 
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them; But now He is pleading for sinners on high, And will give me a home  when He comes by and by. 
3. I once was an out a stranger on earth, 
A sinner by choice, and an alien by birth! But I've been adopted, my name's written down, An  heir to a man a  robe, and a crown. 
4. A tent or a cottage, 
O why should I care? 
They're building a palace for me over there! Tho' exiled from home,  yet still 
I may sing: "All  glory to 
God,  I'm a child of the 
King." I'm a child of the King, a child of the 
King! With Jesus, my Saviour, 
I'm a child of the King!
