##HIGH IN THE HEAVENS
##(Ames. L. M.)
. High in the heav'ns, eternal God, Thy goodness in full glory shines; 
Thy truth shall break thro' ev'ry cloud That vails Thy just and wise   designs. 
2. Forever firm Thy justice stands, As mountains their foundations keep; 
Wise as the wonders of 
Thy hands, Thy judgments are a mighty  deep. 
3. O God, how excellent 
Thy grace, Whence all our hope and comfort spring! 
The sons of Adam, in distress, Fly to the shadow of   
Thy  wing.
