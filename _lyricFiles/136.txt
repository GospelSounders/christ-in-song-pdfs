##THE LAST CALL OF MERCY
##(Solo or Quartet)
. The  last call  of  mercy  now  lin gers for  thee;  
O  sinner,  receive it;  to  
Je sus now  flee! He  often has  called thee, but  thou hast  refused; 
Come His  offered  salvation  and  love are abused. 
2. O  slight not  the  warning  now  of fered at  last,  
Till  summer is  ended  and  har vest is  past; Till  mercy, long  slighted, has  left thy heart's   door,  And  pardon, sweet   pardon  is  of fered no  more. 
3. While  Jesus  is  calling,  
O  turn  not away;  
For  swiftly  approaches  the  dread  Judgment  day; The  
Spirit invites you, 
O  why will you  roam?    now to life's  waters,  ye  thirs ty   come.
