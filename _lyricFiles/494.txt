##THE CROSS THAT HE GAVE
##“...The cross of our Lord Jesus Christ...” (Galatians 6:14).
His grace;  The storm  
I fear I  round me,  I   I            crown for me;  The cup  
I drink   bitter     I            paths of woe;  The toil   work   lighter,     I            in 
His sight;  My all   blood   bringing,  a     face. The cross is not greater than 
His grace, The storm cannot hide 
His blessed face; 
I am satisfied to know 
That with Jesus here below, 
I can conquer ev'ry foe.
