##BOOK DIVINE
##(Horton. 7s.)
. Holy Bible! book divine! 
Pre cious trea sure, thou art mine! Mine to tell me  whence  I came; Mine to teach me what  
I am; 
2. Mine to chide me when I rove; 
Mine  to show  a 
Sav iour's love; Mine to guide my  way ward feet; Mine  to judge,  condemn,  acquit; 
3. Mine to comfort in distress, 
If  the Ho ly 
Spir it bless; Mine to show by  liv ing faith, Man  can triumph over death; 
4. Mine to tell of joys to come, 
In  the saint's  eter nal home: O thou holy  
Book  divine, Pre cious trea sure, thou  art mine!
