##WE LIVE ANEW
##(Newell. C. M.)
. Baptized into our 
Saviour's death, Our souls to sin  must die;  
With Christ our Lord we live anew, With 
Christ ascend  on high, 
With Christ ascend  on high.  
2. There by His Father's side He sits, Enthroned divine ly fair;  
Yet owns Himself our 
Brother still, And our forerun ner there, 
And our forerun ner there.  
3. Rise from these earthly trifles, rise On wings of faith  and love;  
Above, our choicest treasure lies,â€” And be our hearts  above, 
And be our hearts  above.
