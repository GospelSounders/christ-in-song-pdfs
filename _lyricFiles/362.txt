##THE WORD
##(Ortonville. C. M.)
. A glory in the word we find 
When grace restores our sight;  But sin has darkened all the mind, 
And  vail'd the heav'nly light,  And vail'd the heav'nly light.  
2. When God's own Spirit clears our view, 
How bright the doctrines shine!  Their holy fruits and sweetness show 
The  author is divine,  The author is divine.  
3. How blest are we, with open face 
To view Thy glory, 
Lord,  And all Thy image here to trace, 
Reflected in 
Thy word!  Reflected in 
Thy word!  
4. O teach us, as we look, to grow 
In holiness and love,  That we may long to see and know 
Thy  glorious face above, Thy glorious face above.
