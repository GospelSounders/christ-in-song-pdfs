##LOVE THAT WILL NOT LET ME GO
##(Margaret. 8, 8, 8, 8, 6.)
. O Love that will not let me go,  
I rest my weary soul in 
Thee:  I give Thee back the life 
I owe,  That in Thine ocean depths its flow 
May richer, fuller  be! 
2. O Light that followest my way,  
I yield my flick'ring torch to 
Thee;  My heart restores its borrowed ray,  That in Thy sunshine's glow its day 
May brighter, fairer  be! 
3. O Joy that seekest me thro' pain,  
I cannot close my heart to 
Thee;  I trace the rainbow thro' the rain,  And feel the promise is not vain, 
That morn shall tearless  be! 
4. O cross that liftest up my head,  
I dare not ask to hide from thee:  I lay in dust life's glory dead,  And from the ground there blossoms red, 
Life that shall endless  be!
