##ALWAYS WITH US
##(Ripley. 8s  7s. D.)
. Always with us, always with us, 
Words of cheer and words of love; 
Thus the risen Saviour whispers, 
From His dwellingplace above. 
With us when we toil in sadness, 
Sowing much, and reaping none; 
Telling us that in the future, 
Golden har vests shall be won. 
2. With us when the storm is sweeping, 
O'er our path way dark and drear; 
Waking hope within our bosoms, 
Stilling ev'ry anxious fear. 
With us in the lonely valley, 
When we cross the chilling stream; 
Lighting up the gloomy shadows 
With salvation's  radiant beam.
