##IN THE HOUR OF TRIAL
##(Penitence. 6s  5s. D.)
. In the hour of trial, 
Father, strengthen me; 
Lest by base denial, 
I depart from Thee.  When 
Thou see'st me waver, 
With a touch recall,   
Nor from Thy dear favor, 
Suffer me to fall. 
2. With forbidden pleasures 
Would this vain world charm, 
Or its sordid treasures 
Spread to work me harm;  By 
Thy love sustain ing, 
Father keep Thy child;   
All my foes restraining, 
And my passions wild. 
3. Should Thy mercy send me 
Sorrow, care, and woe; 
Or should pain attend me 
On my path below:  Grant that I may nev er 
Fail Thy hand to see;   
Grant that I may ever 
Cast my care on Thee. 
Amen.
