##MY SABBATH HOME
##Dr. C. R. Blackwell
. Sweet Sabbath School! more dear to  me 
Than fairest palace  dome, 
My heart e'er turns with joy to  thee, 
My own dear Sabbath 
Home. 
2. Here first my wilful, wand 'ring  heart, 
The way of life was  shown; 
Here first I sought the bet ter  part, 
And gained a Sabbath 
Home. 
3. Here Jesus stood with lov ing  voice, 
Entreating me to  come, 
And make of Him my on ly  choice, 
In this dear Sabbath 
Home. Sabbath home! blessed home! Sabbath home! blessed home! My Sweet home!  
Sweet home!  Sweet home!  
Sweet home! heart e'er turns with joy  to  thee, 
My own dear Sabbath Home.
