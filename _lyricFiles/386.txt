##DAY OF REST AND GLADNESS!
##(Mendebras. 7s  6s. D.)
. O  day of rest  and  gladness, 
O  day of joy  and  light, 
O  balm of care  and  sadness, 
Most  beautiful,  most  bright; 
On thee, the high and lowly, 
Who bend be fore the throne, 
Sing, Holy, holy, holy, 
To the E ter nal  
One. 
2. Thou  art a port  protected 
From  storms that round  us  rise, 
A  garden in tersected 
With  streams of par adise; 
Thou art a cooling fountain 
In life's dry,  dreary sand; 
From thee, like Pisgah's mountain, 
We view our pro mised  land. 
3. A  day of sweet reflection 
Thou  art, a day  of  love; 
A  day to raise affection 
From  earth to things above. 
New graces ever gaining 
From this our day of rest, 
We seek the rest remaining 
In mansions of  the  blest.
