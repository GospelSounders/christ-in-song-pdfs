##PRAISE THE KING OF HEAVEN
##(Regent Square. 8s. 7s. 6 lines.)
. Praise, my soul, the King of 
Heaven, To His feet thy tribute bring; Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, Who like thee His  praise should sing? 
Praise Him! praise Him! Praise 
Him! praise Him! Praise the everlasting King!  
2. Praise, Him for His grace and favor To our fathers in distress; Praise 
Him, still the  same forever, Slow to chide, and  swift to bless: 
Praise Him! praise Him! Praise 
Him! praise Him! Glorious in 
His  faithful ness. 
3. Frail as summer's flow'r we flourish, Blows the wind, sad it is gone; But while mortals  rise and perish, God endures unchanging on. 
Praise Him! praise Him! Praise 
Him! praise Him! Praise the high eternal  One! 
4. Angels help us to adore Him: Ye behold 
Him face to face; Sun and moon, bow  down before 
Him, Dwellers all in  time and space, 
Praise Him! praise Him! Praise 
Him! praise Him! Praise with us the  God of grace!
