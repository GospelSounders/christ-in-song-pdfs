. Heaven is not far away, 
When Jesus is near;  Give your heart to 
Him today, When Jesus is near.  
Place your trust in this dear 
Friend, He will keep you to the end; 
2. Will you not repent, believe, 
When Jesus is near?  Peace and pardon now receive, When Jesus is near.  
He will not  your pray'r refuse, Come and now  the 
Saviour choose; 
3. Are you coming home today, 
When Jesus is near?  Do not longer stay away, When Jesus is near.  
Cast your bur dens on the 
Lord, He has pro mised in His word; Heaven is not far away, 
When Jesus is near.
