##Lot “...pitched his tent toward Sodom...” (Genesis 13:12).
1. Are you tenting on the lowlands Of the fated, flow'ry plain?  
Are you nearing life's high mountains, As the night comes on again? 

2. Does fair Sodom in her glory Beckon you with ease or gain?  
Heed her awful judgment story; Linger not, her joys are vain. 

3. To the mountains of salvation! Hear the angel, Mercy, call;  
Do not tarry! look not backward! Hasten on ere vengeance fall. 

CHORUS.
Keep tenting toward the highlands(Keep tenting toward the highlands of life),   
Each evening nearer home(sweet home);  
Keep tenting toward the highlands(Keep tenting toward the highlands of life), 
Keep tenting nearer  home (heav'nly home).
