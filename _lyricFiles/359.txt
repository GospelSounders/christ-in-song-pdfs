##THE VOICE OF JESUS
##Horatius Bonar
. I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
"Come unto Me and rest;  
Lay down; thou weary one, lay down 
Thy head upon My breast."  
I came to Jesus as 
I was— Weary, and worn,  and sad;  
I found in Him a restingplace, And He has made me glad.  
2. I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
"Behold, I freely give  
The living water; thirsty one, 
Stoop down and drink and live."  
I came to Je sus, and 
I drank Of that life giving stream;  
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, And now I live in 
Him.  
3. I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
"I am this dark world's light.  
Look unto Me; thy morn shall rise, 
And all thy days be bright."  
I look'd to Je sus and 
I found In Him my star, my sun;  
And in that light of life 
I'll walk, Till all my journey's done.
