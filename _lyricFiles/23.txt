##REPEATING CALVARY

###“Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid” (Romans 6:1-2).
1. I cannot drive the nails again, 
I cannot thrust the spear of pain, 
I cannot bear to see His grief and agony, 
Repeating Calvary By tho't of sin &c.

2. 'Twas sin alone that nailed Him there, 
'Twas love alone that made Him bear; 
Sin's wage of death, our due, Upon Himself He drew 
That we may live anew, His glory share, &c.

3. His power frees from fetters strong, 
All who confess and turn from wrong: 
He could have shunned the pain, Sin's pow'r would yet remain; 
Now law and pardon reign, The angels' song, &c.

4. My soul abhors His mur d'rer sin, 
No longer shall he dwell within; 
But Christ, the living law, Victor in holy war, 
Enthroned forevermore, Gives pow'r to win, &c.
