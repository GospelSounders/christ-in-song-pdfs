##A PRESENT HELP
##(Berthold. Irreg.)
. There is never a day so dreary, 
But  God can  make it bright; 
And  to the soul that trusts Him, He  giveth  pure delight; 
There is never a path so hidden, But  God will  show the way, 
If we will seek His guidance, 
And  patiently wait and pray. 
2. There is never a cross so heavy, 
But  Jesus'  hands are there, 
Outstretched in sweet compassion, Our  burdens  still to bear; 
There is never a life so darkened, So  hopeless,  so unblest, 
But may be fill'd with gladness; 
In  Jesus'  peace may rest. 
3. There is never a heart so broken, 
But  Jesus  Christ can heal; 
The  heart once pierced on 
Calv'ry Doth  for His  people feel; 
He will ever fulfill 
His promise, His  word can  never fail; 
God is our help in trouble, 
Our  strength when  foes assail.
