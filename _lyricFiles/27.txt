###“...As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God...” (John 1:12).
1. Would you be free from your burden of sin? 
There's pow'r in the blood,  pow'r in the blood; 
Would you o'er evil a victory win? 
There's wonderful pow'r in the blood.

2. Would you be free from your passion and pride? 
There's pow'r in the blood,  pow'r in the blood; 
Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide, 
There's wonderful pow'r in the blood. 

3. Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow? 
There's pow'r in the blood,  pow'r in the blood; 
Sin stains are lost in its lifegiving flow, 
There's wonderful pow'r in the blood. 

4. Would you do service for Jesus your King? 
There's pow'r in the blood,  pow'r in the blood; 
Would you live daily His praises to sing? 
There's wonderful pow'r in the blood. 

CHORUS.
There is pow'r, pow'r (There is pow'r), wonder-working pow'r 
in the blood (&c) of the Lamb (&c); 
There is pow'r, pow'r (There is pow'r), wonder-working pow'r 
In the precious blood of the Lamb.
