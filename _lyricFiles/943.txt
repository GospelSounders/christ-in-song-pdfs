##NO SORROW THERE
##(S. M.)
. There'll be  no grief  in heav'n; 
For life  is one glad day, 
And tears  are those of former things  
Which all  have passed  away. 
2. There'll be  no sin  in heav'n; 
Behold  that blessed throng, 
All ho ly in  their spotless robes,  
All ho ly in their song. 
3. There'll be  no death  in heav'n; 
For they  who gain that shore 
Have won  their im mortality,  
And they  can die  no more. 
There'll be  no sorrow there, 
There'll be  no sorrow there; 
In heav'n  above,  where all is love, 
There'll  be  no sorrow there.
