##SOUND THE BATTLE CRY
##“...If God be for us, who can be against us?” (Romans 8:31).
. Sound the battle cry, See! the foe is nigh; 
Raise the standard high For the  Lord; Gird your armor on, 
Stand firm, ev'ry one, 
Rest your cause upon 
His holy word. 
2. Strong to meet the foe, Marching on we go, 
While our cause we know Must pre vail; Shield and banner bright, 
Gleaming in the light, 
Battling for the right, 
We ne'er can fail. 
3. O Thou God of all, Hear us when we call, 
Help us, one and all, By 
Thy  grace; When the battle's done, 
And the vict'ry won, 
May we wear the crown 
Before Thy face.     rally round the banner! 
Ready, steady, pass the word along; 
Onward, forward, shout a loud 
Hosanna! Christ is Captain of the faithful throng.
