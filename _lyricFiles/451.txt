##BEFORE JEHOVAHâ€™S THRONE
##(Duke Street. L. M.)
. Before Jehovah's  awful  throne, Ye nations bow with sa cred joy: Know that the 
Lord  is  God  alone; 
He can create,   and 
He destroy. 
2. We'll crowd Thy gates with  thankful  songs, High as the heav'ns our voi ces raise; And earth, with her  ten  thousand  tongues, 
Shall fill Thy courts   with sounding praise. 
3. Wide as the world is  
Thy command, Vast as eternity  
Thy love; Firm as a rock  Thy  truth  shall  stand, 
When rolling years   shall cease to move.
