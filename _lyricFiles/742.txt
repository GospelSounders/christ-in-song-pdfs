##GLIDING SWIFTLY BY
##(Shining Shore. 8s  7s. P.)
. My days are gliding swiftly by; 
And I, a pilgrim stranger, 
Would not detain them as they flyâ€” 
These hours of toil and danger; 
2. We'll gird our loins, my brethren dear, 
Our distant home discerning; 
Our absent Lord has left us word, 
Let ev'ry lamp be burning. 
3. Should coming days be cold and dark, 
We need not cease our singing; 
That perfect rest naught can molest, 
Where golden harps are ringing. 
4. Let sorrow's rudest tempests blow, 
Each cord on earth to sever, 
Our King says, Come, and there's our home, 
Forever, O, forever! 
For O, we stand on Jordan's strand, 
And soon we'll all pass over; 
And just before, the shining shore 
We may almost discover.
