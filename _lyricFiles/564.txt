##WE HAVE AN ANCHOR
##“Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast...” (Hebrews 6:19).
. Will your anchor hold in the storm of life, When the clouds unfold their  wings of strife? When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain, 
Will your anchor drift,  or our firm remain? 
2. If 'tis safely moor'd, 'twill the storm withstand, For 'tis well secured by the 
Saviour's hand; And the cables, pass'd from 
His heart to thine, 
Can defy the blast,  thro'  strength divine. 
3. It will firmly hold in the straits of 
Fear, When the breakers tell that the reef is near, Tho' the tempest rave and the wild winds blow, 
Not an angry wave  shall  bark o'erflow. 
4. It will surely hold in the floods of death, When the waters cold chill our latest breath, On the rising tide it can never fail, 
While our hopes abide  within the veil. 
5. When our eyes behold, in the dawning light, Shining gates of pearl, our  harbor bright, We shall anchor fast to the heav'nly shore, 
With the storms all past forevermore. 
We have an anchor that keeps the soul 
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll; 
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move, 
Grounded firm and deep in the 
Saviour's love.
