##HOLY SPIRIT, FAITHFUL GUIDE
##(Guide. 7s D.)
. Holy Spirit, faith ful 
Guide, Ever near the 
Chris tian's side; Gently lead us by  the hand, 
Pilgrims in a des ert land; 
Weary souls fore'er rejoice, 
When they hear that sweetest voice, 
2. Ever present, tru est 
Friend, Ever near Thine aid  to lend, Leave us not to doubt  and fear, 
Groping on in dark ness drear; 
When the storms are raging sore, 
Hearts grow faint, and hopes give o'er. 
3. When our days of toil  shall cease, Waiting still for sweet  release, Nothing left but heaven  and prayer, 
Wond'ring if our names  are there; 
Wading deep the dis mal flood, 
Pleading nought but Jesus' blood, 
Whisper softly, "Wand'rer, come! 
Follow Me, I'll guide  thee home."
