##THE THOUGHT OF THEE
##(St. Agnes. C. M.)
. Jesus, the very thought of 
Thee, With sweetness fills the breast; 
But sweeter far Thy face to see, And in 
Thy presence rest. 
2. No voice can sing, no heart can frame, Nor can the mem'ry find 
A sweeter sound than 
Jesus' name, The Saviour of mankind. 
3. O hope of ev'ry contrite heart! O joy of all the meek! 
To those who fall, how kind Thou art! How good to those who seek!
