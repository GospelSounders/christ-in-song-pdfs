##COURAGE, BROTHER!
##(Trust. 8s, 7s. P.)
. Courage, brother! do  not  stumble, 
Tho' thy path be dark as night; 
There's a star to guide the humble: 
Trust in God, and do the right. 
Let the road be rough and dreary, 
And its end far out wardof sight, 
Foot it bravely; strong  or weary, 
Trust in God, trust in God, 
Trust in God and   do the right. 
2. Perish policy  and cunning, 
Perish all that fears the light. 
Whether losing, whether winning, 
Trust in God, and do the right. 
Trust no party, sect, or faction; 
Trust no leaders in the fight; 
Put in ev'ry word  or action 
Trust in God, trust in God, 
Trust in God and   do the right. 
3. Some will hate thee, some  will love thee, 
Some will flatter, some will slight; 
Cease from man, and look above thee: 
Trust in God, and do the right. 
Take His word for safest guiding, 
Inward peace, and in might, 
Star upon our path  abidingâ€” 
Trust in God, trust in God, 
Trust in God and   do the right.
