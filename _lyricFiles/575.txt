##LIVING IS GIVING
##“Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account” (Philppians 4:17).
. Give! said the golden sun: 
Up  rose the mist, 
Safe in the silver clouds 
Cradled and kissed. Give! said the thirsty earth: Down came the show'r; 
Give! said the raindrops bright, 
Up sprang the flow'r. 
2. Give! said the little stream: 
Up  gushed the spring, 
In shady forest nook, 
Where robins sing. Give! said the river wide: Brooks  hurried down. 
Give! said the ocean tide: 
Rivers flowed on. 
3. Give! said the midnight moon: 
Swift  came the light, 
Borrowed from faroff sun, 
Cheering the night. Help! said the 
"Milky Way:" Stars heard the call, 
11Orion, Pleiades, 
Dipper and all. 
4. Give! cried a sinful world: 
Down  came the Lord, 
He who made everything 
Just by His word. Give! cries the heathen child, Hun gry for love: 
Yes! say our pennies bright, 
Lent from above. 
Liv*ing is giving, giving is living; 
All things would die if only receiving. 
Give! this is the rule of love by which we live.
