##WATCH AND PRAY
##“Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong” (I Corinthians 16:13).
. Watch, for the time  is  short;  
Watch while 'tis called today; 
Watch lest the world prevail;  
Watch, Christian, watch and pray; 
Watch, for the flesh is  weak;  
Watch, for the foe is  strong; 
Watch lest the Bridegroom  come;  
Watch, tho' He tarry  long. 
2. Chase slumber from  thine  eyes,  
Chase doubting from thy  breast; 
Thine is the promis'd  prize  
Of heaven's eternal rest; 
Watch, Christian, watch and  pray;  
Thy Saviour watched for  thee 
Till from His brow  there  poured  
Great drops of agony. 
3. Take Jesus for  thy  trust;  
Watch while the foe is  near; 
Gird well the ar mor  on;  
Watch till thy Lord appear. 
Now when thy sun is  up,  
Make thou no more delay, 
In this accept ed  time  
Watch, Christian, watch and  pray. 
O watch   and pray,   
O watch  and  
O watch and pray, O watch and pray, 
O watch and pray, O pray;   
O  watch in the darkness, and watch in the day; 
Christian,  watch and pray.
