##TO BE LIVING IS SUBLIME
##(The Alarm. 8s  7s. D.)
. We are living, we are dwelling, 
In a grand and awful time, In an age on ages telling, 
To be liv ing  is sublime. 
Hark! the waking up of nations, 
Gog and Magog to the fray; 
Hark! what soundeth? Is creation 
Groaning for her latter  day? 
2. Christain, rouse and arm for conflict, 
Nerve thee for the battle field; Bear the helmet of salvation, 
And the might y  gospel shield; 
Bind the breastplate firmly on thee, 
Take the Spirit's sword in hand; 
Boldly, fearlessly, go forth  then, 
In Jehovah's strength to stand.  
3. Wicked spirits gather round thee, 
Legions of those foes to 
God— Principalities most mighty— 
Walk unseen  the  earth abroad; 
They are gath'ring to the battle, 
Strengthen'd for the last deep strife; 
Christian, arm! be watchful, read y, 
Struggle manfully for  life.
