##TEACH ME, THAT I MAY TEACH
##(Nocturn. L. M.)
. O teach me, Lord, that 
I may  teach The precious things Thou dost  impart; 
And wing my words, that they   may  reach The hidden depths of many a heart. 
2. O fill me with Thy ful ness,  Lord, Until my very heart o'erflow 
In kindly tho't  and glow  ing  word, Thy love to tell, 
Thy praise to show. 
3. O use me, Lord, use e ven  me, Just as 
Thou wilt, and when, and where; 
Until Thy bless ed face   
I  see, Thy rest, Thy joy, 
Thy glory share.
