##O COME, LET US SING!
##“Sing aloud unto God our strength...” (Psalm 81:1).
. O come, let us sing un tothe Lord; 
Let us heartily rejoice in the Strength of our 
Salvation. Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, 
And show ourselves glad in  Him with psalms. 
2. For the Lord is a great  God, 
And a great King above all gods. In His hand are all the corners of the earth, 
And the strength of the hills is  His  also. 
3. The sea is His, and He made it; 
And His hands prepar edthe dry  land. O come, let us worship and fall down, 
Let us kneel before the  Lord, our 
Mak er.
