##I SHALL BE SATISFIED
##“...I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness” (Psalm 17:15).
. Soul amid earthsorrows dwelling, 
Sighing for the strife to cease, 
Lo! the promise sweet foretelling 
Soon shall come the Prince of 
Peace. 
2. Saddened by the world's complaining, 
Burdened with the ceaseless care, 
Tell me! is there rest remaining 
For the toilers over there? 
3. Patient wait God's time for going, 
Murmur not though long thy stay, 
Ever trusting, ever knowing 
Thou shalt dwell with Him some day. 
4. Born of God, the soul can never 
Willing here with sin abide; 
Earth is not the glad forever 
Where the soul is satisfied. I shall be satisfied then, I shall be I shall be sat is fiedwhen  
I a wake,I shall be sat is fiedsatisfied then; 
When the King of kings, with angels attending, 
Rends the azure sky, in glory descending, 
When the saints awake in 
His own likeness, I shall be satisfied then (halelujah! ).
