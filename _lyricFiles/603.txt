##GOD BLESS OUR SCHOOL
##(Russian Hymn. 11s, 10s.)
. God bless our Sabbathschool! 
Christ superintend it, 
Source of true wisdom, yet ruling by love; 
Our great Example and 
Shep herd we follow, 
Till Thy great fold we shall enter above. 
2. Searching Thy holy word, here we assemble, 
Parents and children, the aged and youth, 
Wonderful Counselor, our  minds enlighten, 
Thy Holy Spirit revealing 
Thy truth. 
3. Pow'r both to will and do, 
Lord, Thou hast promised, 
Will Thou hast giv'n, now the power bestow, 
Vainly we call Thee our 
Lord  and our Master, 
Unless we live out the truth that we know.
