##“...God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able...” (I Corinthians 10:13).
1. Yield not to temptation, For yielding is sin,  
Each victory will help you Some other to win;  
Fight manfully onward, Dark passions subdue,  
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through.  

2. Shun evil companions, Bad language disdain,  
God's name hold in rev'rence, Nor take it in vain;  
Be thoughtful and earnest, Kindhearted and true,  
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through.  

3. To him that o'er cometh, God giveth a crown,  
Through faith we shall conquer, Though often cast down;  
He who is our Saviour Our strength will renew,  
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through.

CHORUS.
Ask the Saviour to help you, 
Comfort, strengthen, and keep you; 
He is willing to aid you, 
He will carry you through.
