##CARRY THE JOYFUL TIDINGS
##(Work. 7s  6s. P.)
. Carry the joyful tidings 
To every land and sea; 
Banish the heart dividings,â€” 
Brothers should brothers be; 
Christ died for all the nations, "One flesh and blood," saith He; There are no tribes or stations; 
One in the Lord are we. 
2. God who hath lent His talents, 
Bids us His service choose; 
God who hath lent His riches, 
Bids us in kindness use; 
God who hath freedom giv en, Calls us to make it known; He is preparing heaven 
Not for ourselves alone. 
3. Souls on the Orient mountains, 
Souls in the Northern snows, 
Souls by the Southern fountains, 
Souls where the sunset glows! 
Souls out of Christ the 
Sav iour: O for a 
Church of love, Bearing the priceless favor, 
Pointing the lost above!
