##COMMUNING WITH THEE
##(Mercy. 7s.)
. Softly now  the light of day 
Fades upon our sight away; 
Free from care,  from labor  free, 
Lord,  I would  commune with 
Thee. 
2. Thou, whose all  pervading eye 
Naught escapes,  without, within, 
Pardon each  infirmity, 
O pen fault, and secret sin. 
3. Soon from us the light of day 
Shall forever pass away; 
Then, from sin and sorrow  free, 
Take  us, Lord,  to dwell with 
Thee.
