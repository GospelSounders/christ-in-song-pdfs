##THIS SAME JESUS
##(Deerhurst. 8s  7s. D.)
. "This same Jesus! " O how sweetly 
Fall those words upon the ear, 
Like the swell of faroff music, 
In a nightwatch still and clear,— 
He who healed the hopeless leper, He who dried the widow's tear, 
He who changed to health and gladness Helpless, suff'ring, trembling fear. 
2. "This same Jesus! " When the vision 
Of that last and awful day 
Bursts upon the prostrate spirit, 
Like a midnight lightning ray, 
May we lift our hearts, adoring "This same Jesus," loved and known 
As our own most gracious 
Saviour, Seated on the great white 
Throne,— 
3. He, Himself, and "not another," 
He for whom our hearts have yearned 
Thro' long years of twilight waiting, 
To His ransomed ones returned; 
For this word, O Lord, we bless 
Thee, Bless our Master's changeless name; 
Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus Christ is still the same.
