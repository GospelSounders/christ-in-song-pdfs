##HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED SLEEP
##“...For so he giveth his beloved sleep” (Psalm 127:2).
. Sorrowhood's  andcare may meet,  
The tempest cloud may low'r,  
The surge of sin may beat  
Upon earth's troubled 
2. The din  of war may roll  
With all its raging flight;  
Grief may  oppress the soul 
Thro'out the weary 
3. In child  winsome page,  
In manhood's joyous bloom,  
In feebleness and age, 
In death's dark, gath'ring night;  
God doth His own in safety keep; 
He giveth His beloved sleep, 
He giveth His beloved sleep.
