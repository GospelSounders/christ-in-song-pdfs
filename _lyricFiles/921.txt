##SHALL WE MEET?
##Horace L. Hastings
. Shall we meet beyond the river, Where the surges cease to roll?  Where in all the bright forever, 
Sorrow ne'er shall press the soul? 
2. Shall we meet in that blest harbor, When our stormy voyage is o'er?  Shall we meet and cast the anchor, 
By the fair, celestial shore? 
3. Shall we meet in yonder city, Where the tow'rs or crystal shine?  Where the walls are all of jasper, 
Built for us by hands divine? 
4. Shall we meet with Christ our 
Saviour, When He comes to claim 
His own?  Shall we know 
His blessed favor, 
And sit down upon 
His throne? Shall we meet, shall we meet, 
Shall we meet beyond the river? 
Shall we meet beyond the river, 
Where the surges cease to roll? 
4. We shall meet, we shall meet, 
We shall meet beyond the river! 
We shall meet beyond the river, 
Where the surges cease to roll!
