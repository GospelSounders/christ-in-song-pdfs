##SABBATH EVE
##(Malvern. L. M.)
. How sweet the light of 
Sab bath  eve! How soft the sunbeam ling 'ring  there! 
For those blest hours the world 
I  leave, Wafted on wings of faith  and  pray'r. 
2. Season of rest! the tran quil  soul Feels the sweet calm, and melts  in  love; 
And while these sacred mo ments  roll, Faith sees a smiling heav'n  above. 
3. Nor will our days of toil  be  long; Our pilgrimage will soon  be  trod; and we shall join the cease less  song, The endless 
Sabbath of our  God.
