##BENEDICTION
##(Coatham. C. M.)
. The Lord be with us as  we bend 
His blessing to  receive; 
His gift of peace upon  us send, 
Before His courts  we leave. 
2. The Lord be with us as  we walk 
Along our homeward road; 
In silent thought or friend ly talk 
Our hearts be still  with 
God. 
3. The Lord be with us till  the night 
Enfold us all  to rest; 
Be He of ev'ry heart  the light, 
Of ev'ry home  the guest.
