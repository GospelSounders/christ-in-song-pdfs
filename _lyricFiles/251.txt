##TWO LITTLE HANDS
##“...As long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord” (I Samuel 1:28).
. I've two little hands to work for 
Jesus, One little tongue 
His praise to tell, Two little ears to hear His counsel, One little voice a song to swell. 
2. I've two little feet to tread the pathway Up to the heav'nly courts above; Two little eyes to read the Bible, Telling of 
Jesus' wondrous love. 
3. I've one little heart to give to 
Jesus, One little soul for Him to save, One little life for 
His dear service, One little self that He must have. 
Lord, we come, Lord, we come, 
In our childhood's early morning, 
Lord, we come, Lord, we come, 
Come to learn of Thee.
