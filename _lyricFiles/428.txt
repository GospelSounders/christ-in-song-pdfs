##THE SPRING-TIDE
##(Raphael. C. M.)
. The springtide hour brings leaf and flow'r,  
With songs  of life and love,  
And many a lay to cheer the day  
In many a leafy grove.  
2. Dews fall apace— the dews of grace—  
On souls  made sad by sin;  
And love divine delights to shine  
Upon  the waste within.  
3. As year by year the flow'rs appear,  
And birds  their praises sing,  
Why not, my heart, bear well thy part, 
In na ture's joyous spring?  
4. Lord, let Thy love, fresh from above,  
Soft as  the south wind blow,  
Till my heart bloom in sweet perfume,  
And fra grant spices flow.
