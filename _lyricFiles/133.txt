##THOU ART THE WAY
##(Bliss. C. M.)
. Thou art the Way, to Thee alone, From sin and death we flee; 
And he who would the  
Father seek, Must seek 
Him, Lord, by Thee. 
2. Thou art the Truth; Thy word alone, True wisdom can impart; 
Thou only canst inform the mind, And purify the heart. 
3. Thou art the Life; the rending tomb Proclaims Thy conq'ring arm; 
And those who put their  trust in Thee, Nor death nor hell shall harm. 
4. Thou art the Way; the Truth, the 
Life; Grant us that way to know, 
That truth to keep, that  life to win, Whose joys eternal flow.
