##WHO IS ON THE LORD’S SIDE?
##“Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the Lord’s side?...” (Exodus 32:26).
1. Who is on the Lord's side? Always true; 
There's a right and wrong side, Where stand you?

2. Thousands on the wrong side Choose to stand; 
Still 'tis not the strong side, True and grand.

3. Come and join the Lord's side; Ask you why? 
'Tis the only safe side By and by. 

CHORUS.
Choose now (Who is on the Lord's side), Choose now (Who is on the Lord's side), 
On the right or wrong side? 
False or true? 
Choose now (Who is on the Lord's side?), Choose now (Who is on the Lord's side?), 
On the right or wrong side? 
Where stand you?
