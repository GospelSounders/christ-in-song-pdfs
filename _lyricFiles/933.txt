##BREAK, ETERNAL DAY
##(America. 6s  4s.)
. Break, break, eternal day, Bid darkness flee away; Pour on our sight 
Light from the world of joy, 
Bliss pure without alloy; 
Then ne'er  shall  gloom annoy: 
All  shall be bright. 
2. Rise, rise, Thou glorious 
Sun, Hasten Thy race to run; At God's command 
Extend Thy healing wings, 
Open joy's longsealed springs 
Reign, O  Thou  King of kings, 
In  this dark land. 
3. Come, come, Thou conqu'ring 
One, Reign Thou upon 
Thy throne, In glory bright; 
Then shall the ransomed raise, 
Unceasing songs of praise, 
Thro'out  eternal days, 
In  realms of light.
