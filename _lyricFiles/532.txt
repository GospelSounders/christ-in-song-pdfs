##SEEKING THE LOST
##“I will seek that which was lost...” (Ezekiel 34:16).
. Seeking the lost, yes, kindly entreating 
Wanderers on the mountains astray,  
"Come unto Me," His message repeating, 
Words of the Master speaking today.  
2. Seeking the lost, and pointing to Jesus 
Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore,  
Leading them forth in ways of salvation, 
Showing the path to life evermore.  
3. Thus would I go, for 
Jesus hath call'd me, 
Him would I follow day unto day; 
Care for the dying, raise up the fallen, 
Pointing the lost to Jesus the way.  
Going afar, afar upon the mountain, 
Bringing the wand'rers, the wand'rers back again, 
Into the fold, the fold of my 
Redeemer, Jesus the Lamb, the  
Lamb for sinners slain.
