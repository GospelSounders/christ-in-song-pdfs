##COMING
##(Hubert. S. M. D.)
. He's  coming once again, 
To  set His people free; 
That  where He is, in glory bright, 
His saints may also be. 
Then  lift the drooping head, 
Look  up, rejoice and sing; 
He  comes in majesty sublime, 
Salvation's glorious 
King! 
2. The  earth shall quake with fear, 
The  heav'ns shall flee away; 
And  where shall guilty man appear 
In that tremendous day? 
No  refuge then is nigh, 
No  shelter from the blast; 
The  might of vengeance vails the sky 
When mercy's day is past. 
3. His  eyes of living flame, 
The  wicked shall devour; 
No  tongue will lightly speak the name 
Of Jesus in that hour. 
No  scorn, no words of hate, 
For  His meek foll'wers then; 
But  prayers and tears that come too late, 
Will mark earth's mighty men.
