##CALM MY MIND
##(Zephyr. L. M.)
. Come, Holy Spirit,  calm my mind, 
And fit me to  approach my 
God; Remove each vain, each worldly tho't, 
And lead me to Thy blest abode. 
2. Hast Thou imparted  to my soul 
A living spark of holy fire? O, kindle now the sacred flame; 
Make me to burn with pure desire. 
3. A brighter faith and  hope impart, 
And let me now  my Saviour see; O, soothe and cheer my burdened heart, 
And bid my spirit rest in  
Thee.
