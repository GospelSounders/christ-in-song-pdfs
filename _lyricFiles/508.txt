##STAND LIKE THE BRAVE
##“...It is high time to awake...let us therefore...put on the armor of light” (Romans 13:11-12).
. O Christian, awake! 'tis the 
Master's command; With helmet and shield, and a sword in thy hand, 
To meet the bold tempter, go, fearlessly go, 
And stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe. 
2. Whatever thy danger, take heed and beware, And turn not thy back, for no armor is there; 
The legions of darkness, if thou wouldst o'erthrow, 
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe. 
3. The cause of thy Master with vigor defend; Be watchful, be zealous, and fight to the end; 
Wherever He leads thee, go, valiantly go, 
And stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe. 
4. Press on, never doubting, thy 
Captain is near, With grace to supply, and with comfort to cheer; 
His love, like a stream in the dessert will flow, 
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe. 
Stand like the brave, stand like the brave, 
Stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
