##JERUSALEM THE GOLDEN
##(Ewing. 7s  6s. D.)
. Jerusalem the golden, With milk and honey blest, Beneath thy contemplation 
Sink heart and voice oppress'd: 
I know not, O I know not, What ho ly joys are there; 
What radiancy of glory, 
What bliss beyond compare. 
2. There is the throne of 
David, And there, from care releas'd, The song of them that triumph, 
The shout of them that feast; 
And they, who with their 
Leader, Have conquered  in the fight, 
Forever and forever 
Are clad in robes of white. 
3. O sweet and blessed country, The home of 
God's elect! O sweet and blessed country, 
That eager hearts expect! 
Jesus in mercy bring us To that  dear land of rest; 
Who art with God the Father, and Spirit ever blest.
