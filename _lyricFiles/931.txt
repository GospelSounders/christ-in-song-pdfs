##SWEET BE THY REST
##(Byron. 4s  6s. D.)
. Sweet  be thy rest, And peace ful thy sleeping; 
God's way is best. Thou art in 
His keep  ing. O blessed sleep, 
Where ills  ne'er molest thee! 
Why should we weep? 
For heaven  hath blessed thee: 
Sweet be thy rest. 
2. Thy  work is done, Thy sow ing and reaping; 
Thy crown is won, And hush'd  is thy weep  ing. From tears and woes, 
From earth's  midnight dreary, 
Thine is repose 
Where none  ever weary: 
Sweet be thy rest. 
3. Sweet  be thy rest; No more  we may greet thee 
Till with the blest In heav en we meet   thee. O union sweet, 
That death can not sever! 
There we shall meet, 
Where sad tears fall never: 
Sweet be thy rest.
