##HELP IN GOD FOR THEE
##(Zephyr. L. M.)
. The tempter to my  soul hath said, 
"There is no help  in God for thee;" 
Lord, lift Thou up Thy servant's head; 
My glory, shield, and solace  be. 
2. Thus to the Lord I  raised my cry; 
He heard me from  His holy hill; 
At His command the waves rolled by; 
He beckoned, and the winds were  still. 
3. I will not fear, tho'  armed throngs 
Compass my steps  in all their wrath; 
Salvation to the Lord belongs; 
His presence guards 
His people's  path.
