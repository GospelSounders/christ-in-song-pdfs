##CALL THEM IN
##Miss Anna Shipton
. "Call them in," the poor, the wretched, Sinstained wand'rers from the fold; 
Naught Peace and pardon freely offer; 
Can you weigh their worth with gold? 
"Call them in," the weak the weary, 
Laden with the doom of sin;  
Bid them come and rest in 
Jesus; He is waiting, 
"Call them in." 
2. "Call them in," the Jew, the 
Gentile; Bid the stranger to the feast:  "Call them in," the rich, the noble, 
From the highest to the least: 
Forth the Father runs to meet them, 
He hath all their sorrows seen;  
Robe, and ring, and royal sandals, Wait the lost ones, 
"Call them in." 
3. "Call them in," the mere professors, Slumbering, sleeping, on death's brink;   of life are they possessors, 
Yet of safety vainly think: 
Bring them in, the careless scoffers, 
Pleasure seekers of the earth:  
Tell of God's most gracious offers, And of Jesus' priceless worth. 
4. "Call them in," the brokenhearted, Cowering 'neath the brand of shame;  Speak love's message low and tender, 
'Twas for sinners Jesus came: 
See, the shadows lengthen round us, 
Soon the daydawn will begin;  
Can you leave them lost and lonely? Christ is coming, 
"Call them in."
