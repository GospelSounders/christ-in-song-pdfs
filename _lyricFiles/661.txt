##NOT MY WAY
##(Rothmann. 6s. D.)
. Thy way,  not mine,  O Lord, 
However dark  it be; 
Lead me  by Thine  own hand, 
And choose the path  for me. 
I dare  not choose  my lot; 
I would not, if  I might; 
Choose Thou  for me,  my 
God, So shall I walk  aright. 
2. The king dom that  I seek 
Is Thine;  so let  the way 
That leads  to it  be Thine, 
Else I  must sure ly stray. 
Hold Thou  my cup  of life; 
With joy  or sor row fill 
As best  to Thee  may seem: Choose Thou  my good and ill. 
3. Choose Thou  for me  my friends, 
My sick ness or  my health; 
Choose Thou  my cares  for me, 
My pov erty  or wealth. 
Not mine,  not mine  the choice, 
In ei ther great  or small; 
Be Thou  my Guide,  my 
Strength, My Wis dom, and  my 
All.
