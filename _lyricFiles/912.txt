##WHO ARE THESE?
##(Neander. 8, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7.)
. Who are these like stars appearing, 
These, be fore God's throne who stand? Each a golden crown is wearing, 
Who are  all this glorious band? 
2. These are they who have contended 
For their  Saviour's honor long, Wrestling on till life was ended, 
Foll'wing  not the sinful throng: 
3. These are they whose hearts were riven, 
Sore with woe and anguish tried, Who in pray'r full oft have striven 
With the  God they glorified: 
4. These, like priests, have watched and waited 
Offering  up to 
God their will; Soul and body consecrated, 
Day and  night to serve 
Him still; Alleluia! hark, they sing, 
Praising loud their heav'nly King. Now in God's most holy place, 
Blest they stand before 
His face.
