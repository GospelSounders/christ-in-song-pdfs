##WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR JESUS?
##“I must work the works of him that sent me...” (John 9:4).

As you journey thro' life?  
Sowing the grain for the harvest, 
Or scattering seeds  of strife?  
2. What are you doing for Jesus? 
Are you striving each day,  
By little acts  of kindness, 
To bright en some one's way?  
3. What are you doing for Jesus? 
Soon comes setting of sun;  
Hasten to tell the glad tidings, 
Lest you leave some work  undone.  
What   are  you doing, 
Do  ing  for Jesus? 
What   are  you do  ing 
As the days go by?      
What   are  you doing, 
Do  ing  for Jesus? 
What   are  you do  ing 
As the days  go by?    
What are you doing for Jesus your friend? 
What are you doing for Jesus today? 
What are you doing for Jesus your friend 
As the days go by, days go by?   
What are you doing for Jesus your friend? 
What are you doing for Jesus today? 
What are you doing for Jesus your friend 
As the days  go  days go by?
