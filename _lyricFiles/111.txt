##ASHAMED OF JESUS
##(Federal Street. L. M.)
. Jesus, and shall it  ever be, A mortal man ashamed of 
Thee? Ashamed of 
Thee, whom angels  praise, 
Whose glories shine through endless days? 
2. Ashamed of Jesus!  sooner far Let evening blush to own a star; He sheds the beams of light  divine 
O'er this benighted soul of mine. 
3. Ashamed of Jesus!  just as soon Let midnight be ashamed of noon; 'Twas midnight with my soul till  He, 
Bright Morning Star, bade darkness flee. 
4. Ashamed of Jesus!  that dear Friend On whom my hopes of heav'n depend! No; when I blush, be this  my  shame, 
That I no more revere 
His name. 
5. Ashamed of Jesus!  yes, 
I may When I've no guilt to wash away; No tear to wipe, no good  to  crave, 
No fears to quell, no soul to save. 
6. Till then,— nor is my  boasting vain,— Till then 
I boast a Saviour slain; And O, may this my glo ry  be, 
That Christ is not ashamed of me!
