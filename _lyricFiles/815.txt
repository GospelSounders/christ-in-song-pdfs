##GENTLE PEACE
##(Rathbun. 8s  7s.)
. Gentle Peace, from heav'n  descended, 
We would live beneath  
Thy law; Thou hast home and life befriended, 
Born of nobler deeds than war. 
2. Thou hast thrown a smile of beauty 
O'er the meadow, hill,  and grove; Thou hast quickened us to  duty. 
Thou hast warmed our hearts to love. 
3. Stay Thou with us, still  replenish 
Fields with fruit, ourselves  with love; Discord and dissen  sion  banish, 
Peaceful spirit from above.
