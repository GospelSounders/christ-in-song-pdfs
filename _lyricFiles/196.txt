##TREAD SOFTLY
##(Solo and Quartet.)
. Be silent, be silent, 
A whisper is heard, 
Be silent, and listen, 
Oh, treasure each word.   
2. Be silent, be silent, 
For ho ly this place, 
This altar that echoes 
The message of grace.   
3. Be silent, be silent, 
Breathe hum bly our pray'r, 
A foretaste of Eden 
This moment we share.   
4. Be silent, be silent, 
His mer cy record; 
Be silent, be silent, 
And wait on the Lord.   
Tread softly, tread softly, 
The Master is here; Tread softly, tread softly, 
He 
Tread soft lyhere, tread soft lyhere,  Master is  Tread soft lyhere, tread soft lyhere,  bids  us draw near.
