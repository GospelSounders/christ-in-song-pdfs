##HE IS CALLING
##(Ladiesâ€™ Voices)
. There's a wideness in 
God's mercy, Like the wideness of the sea; There's a kindness in 
His justice, Which is more than liberty. 
2. There is welcome for the sinner, And more graces for the good; There is mercy with the Saviour; There is healing in His blood. 
3. There's no place where earthly sorrows Are more felt than up in heav'n; There's no place where earthly failings Have such kindly judgment giv'n. 
4. For the love of God is broader Than the measure of man's mind; And the heart of the 
Eternal Is most wonderfully kind. 
5. But we make His love too narrow, By false limits of our own; And we magnify 
His strictness With a zeal 
He will not own. 
6. If our love were but more simple, We should take 
Him at His word; And our lives would be all sunshine In the sweetness of our Lord. He is calling, 
"Come to Me;" Lord, I gladly follow 
Thee!
