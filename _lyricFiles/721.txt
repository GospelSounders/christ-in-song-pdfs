##NO WORK TOO HUMBLE
##(Chenies. 7s  6s. D.)
. There is no work too humble 
For Christian hands to do; 
There is no path too lowly 
For our feet to pursue; 
Our blessed Lord and 
Master Was servant unto all; 
None were too poor and needy 
For Him to heed their call. 
2. If we are His disciples, 
Call'd by His holy name, 
A portion of His Spirit 
We surely ought to claim. 
And tho' the task be me nial Which He for us hath set; 
His own divine example 
We never should forget. 
3. That He, the High and Holy, 
Whose lifework was complete, 
Should gird Himself for labor, 
And washed those humble feet! 
And yet we shrink from du ties Which seem so far above 
This deed of Christlike meekness, 
This tender proof of love!
