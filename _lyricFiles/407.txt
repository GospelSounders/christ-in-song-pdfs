##CHOOSE SOME HERALDS HERE
##(Coatham. C. M.)
. Our Saviour's voice is soft  and sweet, When, bending from above, 
He bids us gather round  
His feet, And calls us by His love. 
2. He leads to heav'n where an gels dwell, He saves from endless woe; 
Our lips, our lives, can nev er tell How much to Christ  we owe. 
3. But while our youthful hearts  rejoice, That thus 
He bids  us come, 
Jesus, we cry with plead ing voice, Bring heathen wan d'rers home. 
4. They never heard the 
Saviour's name, They have not learnt  His way, 
They do not know His grace  who came To take their sins  away. 
5. Dear Saviour, lot the joy ful sound In distant lands  be heard; 
And oh, wherever sin  is found, Send forth 
Thy pard'ning word. 
6. And if our lips may breathe  the pray'r, Tho' raised in trem bling fear, 
Oh, let Thy pow'r our hearts  prepare, And choose some her alds here.
