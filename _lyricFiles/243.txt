##KEEP ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF LIFE
##“...In thy light I shall see light” (Psalm 36:9).
. There's a dark and a troubled side of life; 
There's a bright and a sunny side, too; 
Tho' we meet with the darkness and strife,  
The sunny side we also may view. 
2. Tho' the storm in its fury breaks today, 
Crushing hopes that we cherished so dear; 
Storm and cloud will in time pass away,  
The sun again will shine bright and clear. 
3. Let us greet with a song of hope each day, 
Tho' the moments be cloudy or fair; 
Let us trust in our Saviour alway,  
Who keepeth every one in 
His care. Keep on the sunny side, 
Always on the sunny side, 
Keep on the sunny side of life, 
It will help us every day, 
It will brighten all the way, 
If we keep on the sunny side of life.
