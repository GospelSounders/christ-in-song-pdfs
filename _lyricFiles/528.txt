##THE LORD IS MY LIGHT
##“The Lord is my light and my salvation...” (Psalm 27:1).
. The Lord is my light; then why should I fear? 
By day and by night 
His  presence is near; 
He is my salvation from sorrow and sin; 
This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in. 
2. The Lord is my light; tho' clouds may arise, 
Faith stronger than sight, looks  up to the skies 
Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign: 
Then how can I ever in darkness remain? 
3. The Lord is my light, the 
Lord is my strength, 
I know in His might 
I'll  conquer at length; 
My weakness in mercy 
He covers with pow'r, 
And, walking by faith, 
He upholds me each hour. 
4. The Lord is my light, my all and in all; 
There is in His sight no  darkness at all; 
He is my Redeemer, my Saviour and King; 
With saints and with angels His praises I sing. 
The Lord is my light, my joy and my song; 
By day and by night He  leads me along. 
The Lord is my light, my joy and my song; 
By day and by night He  leads me along.
