##THE SWEETEST NAME
##(8s  7s. P.)
. There is no name so sweet on earth, 
No name so sweet in heaven, The name before 
His wondrous birth To 
Christ the Saviour given. 
2. And when He hung upon the tree, 
They wrote this name above 
Him, That all might see the reason we For evermore must love 
Him. 
3. So now, upon His Father's throne, 
Almighty to release us From sin and pains, 
He ever reigns, The 
Prince and Saviour, Jesus. We love to sing around our 
King, And hail Him blessed 
Jesus; For there's no word ear ever heard 
So dear, so sweet, as Jesus.
