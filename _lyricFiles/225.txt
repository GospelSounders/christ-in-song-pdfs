##WASHED WHITE AS SNOW
##“Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as
. Tho' my sins were once  like crimson red, To the healing stream umph my feet were led; 
In the precious blood death's my Saviour shed 
He washed me white as snow.  
2. At the door of faith  
I entered in, And to Him confessed  my guilt and sin; 
With His own dear hand  
He washed me clean, 
He washed me white as snow.  
3. Tho' my heart was all  
I had to give, Yet 
He smiled and bade  me look and live; 
What a calm, sweet peace  did I receive! — 
He washed me white as snow.  
4. I will sing His pow'r  from death to save, I will sing His trio'er the grave, 
I will sing beyond   chilling wave, 
"He washed me white as snow."  
O my joyful song  henceforth shall be, 
"'Tis the blood of Jesus cleanseth me, 
Cleanseth, cleanseth, O, yes, it cleanseth me."
