##STAND UP FOR JESUS
##(Ellacombe. 7s  6s. D.)
. Stand up! stand  up for Jesus! 
Ye sol diers of the cross; 
Lift high His  royal banner, 
It must  not  suffer loss: 
From  vict'ry unto vict'ry, His  army shall 
He lead, Till ev'ry  foe is vanquished,  
And Christ  is  
Lord indeed. 
2. Stand up! stand  up for Je sus! 
The trum pet call obey; 
Forth to the mighty con flict, 
In this  His glorious day: 
Ye  that are men now serve   
Him, Against unnumbered foes; Let courage  rise with dan ger, 
And strength  to strength oppose. 
3. Stand up! stand  up for Je sus! 
Stand in  His strength alone; 
The arm of flesh will fail  you; 
Ye dare  not trust your own: 
Put  on the gospel ar  mor, And,  watching unto pray'r, Where duty  calls, or dan ger, 
Be nev er  wanting there. 
4. Stand up! stand  up for Je sus! 
The strife  will not be long; 
This day the  noise of bat tle, 
The next  the  victor's song: 
To  him that overcom  eth, A  crown of life shall be; He with the  
King of Glo ry 
Shall reign  eternally.
