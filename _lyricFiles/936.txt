##COME
##(Tamworth. 8s  7s. 6L.)
. Christ is coming! let creation 
Bid her groans and travails cease; Let the glorious proclamation Hope restore and faith increase; Christ is coming! 
Christ is coming! Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace! 
2. Earth can now but tell the story 
Of Thy bitter cross and pain; She shall soon behold 
Thy glory, When Thou comest back to reign; Christ is com ing! 
Christ is com ing! Let each heart repeat the strain. 
3. Long Thy exiles have been pining, 
Far from rest, and home, and 
Thee; But, in heav'nly vesture shining, Soon they shall 
Thy glory see; Christ is com ing! 
Christ is com ing! Haste the joyous jubilee. 
4. With that "blessed hope" before us, 
Let no harp remain unstrung; Let the mighty advent chorus Onward roll, from tongue to tongue; Christ is com ing! 
Christ is com ing! Come, Lord 
Jesus, quickly come!
