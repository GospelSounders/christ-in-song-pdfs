##WEARY OF EARTH
##(Langran. 10s.)
. Weary of earth and laden with my sin, 
I look to heav'n and long to enter in; 
But there no evil thing may find a home: 
And yet I hear a voice that bids me 
"Come." 
2. The while I fain would tread the heav'nly way, 
Evil is ever with me day by day; 
Yet on mine ears the gracious tidings fall, 
"Repent, return, thou shalt be loos'd from all." 
3. Cease, restless will! thy lonely strife resign! 
I know too well how little strength is mine; 
Grant me, dear Lord, Thy saving love to see: 
I strive no more, I give myself to 
Thee.
