##WE THANK THEE
##(Hursley. L. M.)
. Father, we thank  Thee for  the night, 
And for the pleasant morn ing light; 
For rest, and food,  and loving care, 
And all that makes the day so fair. 
2. Help us to do  the things  we should, 
To be to oth ers kind  and good; 
In all we do,  at work or play, 
To grow more lov ing ev 'ry day.
