##A MIGHTY FORTRESS
##(Einâ€™ Feste Burg. P. M.)
. A mighty for tress is our  
God, A bulwark never fail  ing; 
Our helper He,  amid  the  flood 
Of mortal ills prevail  ing. 
For still our ancient  foe 
Doth seek to work his woe; 
His craft and pow'r are  great, 
And, arm'd with cruel hate; 
On earth is not his equal. 
2. Did we in our  own strength  con fide, Our striving would be los  ing; 
Were not the right Man on  our  side, 
The Man of God's own choos  ing. 
Doth ask who that may  be? 
Christ Jesus, it is He! 
Lord Sabaoth is His  name, 
From age to age the same; 
And He must win the bat  tle. 
3. And tho' this world,  with devils  filled, Should threaten to undo   us, 
We will not fear,  for God  hath  will'd 
His truth to triumph thro'   us. 
Let goods and kindred  go, 
This mortal life also; 
The body they may  kill; 
God's truth abideth still, 
His kingdom is forev  er.
