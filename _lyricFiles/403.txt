##THE KING OF LOVE
##(Dominus Regit Me, 8s, 7s, Irregular.)
. The King of love my 
Shepherd is, Whose goodness faileth never; I nothing  lack if I am  
His, And  He is mine forever. 
2. Where streams of living water flow My ransomed soul 
He lead eth, And where the  verdant pastures  grow, With  food celestial feed eth. 
3. Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed, But yet in love 
He sought  me, And on 
His shoulder gently  laid, and  home, rejoicing, brought  me. 
4. And so thro' all the length of days Thy goodness faileth nev er, Good Shepherd! I would sing Thy  praise Within Thy house forev er.
