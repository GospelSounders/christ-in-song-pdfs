##A SINNER LIKE ME
##C. J. Butler

1. I was once far away from the Saviour,  And as vile as a sinner could be;  
I  wondered if Christ, the Redeemer, Could  save a poor sinner like me.  

2. I  wandered on in the darkness,  Not a ray  of light could I see,  
And the tho't filled my heart  with sadness,  There's no help for a sinner like me.

3. And  then in that dark, lonely hour,   A  voice sweetly whispered to me,  
Saying Christ, the Redeemer has power  To  save a poor sinner like me.  

4. I  listened, and lo! 'twas the Savior  Who was speaking so kindly to me; 
I  cried, I'm the chief  of sinners,  Oh,  save a poor sinner like me.

5. I  then fully trusted in Jesus,  And, oh, what  a joy came to me!  
My  heart was filled with  His praises,  For  saving a sinner like me. 

6. No  longer in darkness I'm walking,  For the light is now shining on me,  
And  now unto others  I'm telling  How He saved a poor sinner like me. 

7. And  when  life's journey is over,  And  I the dear Saviour shall see,  
I'll  praise Him forever and ever, For  saving a sinner like me.
