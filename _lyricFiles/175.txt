##ANGELS HOVERING ROUND
##Arranged
. There are angels hov'ring round, 
There are angels hov'ring round, 
There are angels, angels  hov'ring round. 
2. To carry the tidings home, 
To the New Jerusalem, 
There are an  gels, an  gels  hov'ring round. 
3. Let  him that heareth, come, 
O  come, while yet there's room; 
There are an  gels, an  gels  hov'ring round.
