##JOY BY AND BY
##“They that sow in tears shall reap in joy” (Psalm 126:5).
. O there'll be joy when the work is done, 
Joy when the reapers gather home, 
Bringing the sheaves at set of sun To the New 
Jerusalem. 
2. Sweet are the songs that we hope to sing, 
Grateful the thanks our hearts shall bring, 
Praising forever 
Christ our King, In the New 
Jerusalem. 
3. Pure are the joys that await us there, 
Many the golden mansions fair; 
Jesus Himself doth them prepare, In the New 
Jerusalem. Joy, joy,  there'll be joy by and by, 
Joy, joy,  where the joys never die; Joy joy, joy,    joy by and by, 
Joy, joy, joy,    joys never die; 
Joy,  joy  for the day draweth nigh 
When the workers gather home.
