##THE LILY OF THE VALLEY
##Song of Solomon 2:1
. I've  found a friend in 
Jesus, He's ev'rything to me, 
He's the fairest of tenthousand to my soul; The  
Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see 
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole. 
In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay, 
He  tells me ev'ry care on 
Him to roll. 
2. He  all my grief has taken, and all my sorrows borne; 
In temptation He's my strong and mighty tow'r; I've  all for Him forsaken, and all my idols torn 
From my heart, and now 
He keeps me by His pow'r. 
Tho' all the world forsake me, and Satan tempts me sore, 
Thro'  Jesus I shall safely reach the goal. 
3. He'll  never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here, 
While I live by faith and do 
His blessed will; A  wall of fire about me, 
I've nothing now to fear; 
With His manna He my hungry soul doth fill. 
Then sweeping up to glory, 
I'll see His blessed face, 
Where  rivers of delight shall ever roll.          bright and 
Morning Star; He's the fairest of tenthousand to my soul!
