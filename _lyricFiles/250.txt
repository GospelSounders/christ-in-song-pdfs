##DONâ€™T FORGET THE SABBATH
##Fanny Crosby
. Don't forget the Sabbath, the Lord our God hath blest,  
Of all the week the brightest, Of all the week the best;  It brings repose from labor, It tells of joy  divine,  Its beams of light descending, With heav'nly beauty shine.  
2. Keep the Sabbath holy, 
And worship Him today,  
Who said to His disciples, "I am the 
Living Way;"  And if we meek ly follow Our Saviour here below,  He'll give us of the Fountain Whose streams eter nal flow.  
3. Day of sacred pleasure! 
Its golden hours we'll spend  
In thankful hymns to 
Jesus, The children's dearest Friend;  O gentle, lov ing 
Saviour, How good and kind 
Thou art,  How precious is 
Thy promise To dwell in ev 'ry heart!  
Welcome, welcome, ever welcome, 
Blessed Sabbath day.  Welcome, welcome, ever welcome, 
Blessed Sabbath day.
