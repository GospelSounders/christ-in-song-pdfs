##DRAW ME CLOSER TO THEE
##“Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith...” (Hebrews 10:22).
. Closer to Thee, my Father, draw me, 
I long for Thine embrace; Closer within 
Thine arms enfold me, 
I seek a resting place. 
2. Closer to Thee, my Saviour, draw me, 
Nor let me leave Thee more; Fain would I feel 
Thine arms around me, 
And count my wand'rings o'er. 
3. Closer by Thy sweet Spirit draw me, 
Till I am all like 
Thee; Quicken, refine, and wash and cleanse me, 
Till I am pure and free. 
Closer with the cords of love, 
Draw me to Thyself above; 
Closer draw me, 
To Thyself above. 
Clos er,clos er with thecords  of  love, 
Draw me, draw me to Thyself  a bove; 
Clos er withthe cords of love, 
Draw me to Thy-self a bove,
Draw me to Thyself above.
