##SHALL WE KNOW EACH OTHER THERE?
##“...Then shall I know even as also I am known” (I Corinthians 13:12).
. When we hear the music ringing 
In the bright celestial dome,  
When sweet angel voices, singing, 
Gladlya bid us  welcome home, 
To the land of ancient story, 
Where the dwellers know no care,— 
In that land of light and glory;— 
Shall we know each other there? 
2. When the holy angels meet us, 
As we go to join their band,  
Shall we know the friends that greet us 
In the glorious, happy land? 
Shall we see the same eyes shining, 
On us, as in days of yore? 
Shall we feel the same arms twining, 
Fondly round us as before? 
3. Yes, my earthworn soul rejoices, 
And my weary heart grows light;  
For the sweet immortal voices 
And th' gelic faces bright 
That shall sing with us the story 
Of redemption round the throne, 
Are with us the heirs of glory, 
And we'll know as we are known. 
4. O ye weary, sad, and tossed ones! 
Droop not, faint not by the way;  
Ye shall join the loved and lost ones 
In the land of perfect day. 
Harpstrings touched by angel fingers, 
Murmur in my raptured ear; 
Evermore their sweet song lingers, 
"We shall know each other there! " 
Shall we know   each  other? 
Shall we know   each  other? 
Shall we know  each  other? 
Shall we know each other there? 
We shall know   each  other, 
We shall know   each  other, 
We shall know  each  other, 
We shall know each other there.
