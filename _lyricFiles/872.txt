##SOME SWEET DAY
##(Dedicated to W. H. Doane, composer of the first “Some Sweet Day.”)
. We shall meet beyond the skies, 
Some sweet day,  some sweet day; 
Gaze no more in tearful eyes, 
Some sweet day,  some sweet day. 
We  shall clasp our own  again, Free  from sorrow, sin  and pain; We shall wish no more in vain, 
Some sweet day,  some sweet day. 
2. There will be no vacant chair, 
Some sweet day,  some sweet day, 
Nor a mourning circle there, 
Some sweet day,  some sweet day. 
Death  shall hear its note of doom, Christ  shall burst the seal ed tomb, Dust shall wake in beauty's bloom, 
Some sweet day,  some sweet day. 
3. Winter's frost or summer's heat, 
Some sweet day,  some sweet day, 
Make no harvest incomplete, 
Some sweet day,  some sweet day. 
E den bloom is ev 'rywhere, Fade less flow'rs perfume  the air, Christ Himself the sunlight fair, 
Some sweet day,  some sweet day. 
4. Mansion, crown, and harp of gold, 
Some sweet day,  some sweet day; 
Songs that never shall grow old, 
Some sweet day,  some sweet day. 
Joy  shall bid farewell to 
Care, Praise  shall sing no more  with 
Prayer, Love shall lead us, over there, 
Some sweet day,  some sweet day.
