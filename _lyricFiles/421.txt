##THE BEST OF DAYS
##(Schumann. S. M.)
. This is the day of rest: 
Our failing strength renew;  
On weary brain and troubled breast Shed Thou 
Thy fresh'ning dew. 
2. This is the day of peace: 
Thy peace our spirits fill;  
Bid Thou the blasts of discord cease, The waves of strife be still. 
3. This is the day of pray'r: 
Let earth to heav'n draw near;  
Lift up our hearts to seek 
Thee there; Come down to meet us here. 
4. This is the best of days: 
Send forth Thy quick'ning breath,  
And wake dead souls to love and praise, O Vanquisher of death!
