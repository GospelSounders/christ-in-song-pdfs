##WHERE IS MY BOY TO-NIGHT?
##Robert Lowry, D. D.
##Robert Lowry, D. D.
1. Where is my wand'ring boy tonightâ€” The  boy of my tenderest care,  
The boy that was once my joy and light, The child of my love and prayer? 

2. Once he was pure as morning dew, As he knelt at his mother's knee;  
No face was so bright, no heart more true, And none was so sweet as he.  

3. O could I see you now, my boy, As  fair as in olden time,  
When prattle and smile made home a joy, And life was a merry chime;  

4. Go for my wand'ring boy tonight; Go,  search for him where you will;  
But bring him to me with all his blight, And tell him I love him still.  

CHORUS.
O where is my boy tonight?  O where is my boy tonight?  
My heart o'er flows, for I love him, he knows; 
O where is my boy tonight?
