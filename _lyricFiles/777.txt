##THE LIVING LAW
##(Rockingham. L. M.)
. My blest Redeemer and my 
Lord, I read my duty in Thy word; But in Thy life the law appears, 
Drawn out in living characters. 
2. What truth and love Thy bosom fill! What zeal to do 
Thy Father's will! Such zeal, and truth, and love divine 
I would transcribe, and make them mine. 
3. Cold mountains and the midnight air Witnessed the fervor of Thy prayer; The dessert Thy temptations knew, 
Thy conflict, and 
Thy vict'ry too. 
4. Be Thou my pattern; make me bear More of Thy gracious image here; Then 
God, the Judge, shall own my name 
Among the foll'wers of the Lamb.
