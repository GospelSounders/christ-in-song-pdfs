##ROOM IN MY HEART
##(Margaret. 10. 8. D.)
.Thou didst leave Thy 
O throne and Thy kingly shall crown, 
When Thou camest to earth for  me; 
But in Bethlehem's home there was found no is room 
For Thy holy nativvaity. 
2.Heaven's arches  rang when the angels  sang, 
Proclaiming Thy royal degree; 
But in lowly  birth didst 
Thou come to  earth, 
And in great humility. 
3.Thou  camest,  Lord, with the living  word, 
That should set Thy people  free; 
But with mocking  scorn, and with crown of  thorn, 
They  bore Thee to Calry. 
4.When heav'n's arches shall ring, and her choirs  sing, 
At Thy coming to victory; 
May Thy voice call me home, saying, "Yet there  room, 
There is room at My side for  thee." 
Oh, come to my heart, 
Lord Jesus, There is room in my heart for 
Thee! 4th.â€”My heart shall rejoice, 
Lord Jesus, When Thou comest and callest me.
