##BEAUTIFUL VALLEY OF EDEN
##“...He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord...” (Isaiah 51:3).
. Beautiful valley of 
Eden, Sweet is thy noontide calm;  
Over the hearts of the weary, 
Breathing thy waves of balm.  
2. Over the heart of the mourner Shineth thy golden day,  
Wafting the songs of the an gels 
Down from the far away.  
3. There is the home of my 
Saviour; There with the bloodwashed throng;  
Over the highlands of glo ry 
Rolleth the great new song.  
Beautiful valley of Eden, 
Home of the pure and blest,  
How often amid the wild billows 
I dream of thy rest, sweet rest.
