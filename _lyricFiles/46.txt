###“I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep” (John 10:11).
1. Jesus, the loving Shepherd, Calleth thee now to come  
Into the fold of safety, Where there is rest  and room;  
Come in the strength of manhood, Come in the morn of youth, 
Enter the fold  of safety, Enter the way  of truth.  

2. Jesus, the loving Shepherd, Gave His dear life for thee,  
Tenderly now He's calling, Wanderer, come  to me;  
Haste, for without  is danger, Come, cries the Shepherd blest,  
Enter the fold  of safety, Enter the place  of rest.  

3. Lingering is but folly, Wolves are abroad today,  
Seeking the sheep now straying, Seeking the lambs  to slay;  
Jesus, the loving Shepherd, Calleth thee now to come  
Into the fold  of safety, Where there is rest  and room.  

CHORUS.
Lovingly, tenderly calling is He;
Wanderer, wanderer, come unto Me, 
Patiently standing there, waiting, I see 
Jesus my Shepherd divine.
