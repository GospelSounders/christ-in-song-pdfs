##ONE MORE DAY’S WORK FOR JESUS
##“...To every man his work...” (Mark 13:34).
. One more day's work for 
Jesus, One less of life for me; But heav'n is nearer, 
And Christ is dearer, 
Than yesterday to me; 
His love and light 
Fill all my soul tonight. 
2. One more day's work for 
Jesus; How glorious is my King! 'Tis joy, not duty, 
To speak His beauty; 
My soul mounts on the wing 
At the mere tho't 
How Christ my life has bought. 
3. One more day's work for 
Jesus, How sweet the work has been, To tell the story, 
To show the glory 
Where Christ's flock enter in! 
How it did shine in this poor heart of mine! 
4. One more day's work for 
Jesus,— O yes, a weary day; But heav'n shines clearer, 
And rest comes nearer, 
At each step of the way; 
And Christ in all— 
Before His face I fall. 
5. O blessed work for 
Jesus! O rest at 
Jesus' feet! There toil seems pleasure, 
My wants are treasure, 
And pain for Him is sweet; 
Lord, if I may, 
I'll serve another day. 
One more day's work for 
Jesus, One more day's work for 
Jesus, One more day's work for 
Jesus, One less of life for me.
