##COMING TO THE CROSS

1. I am coming to the cross, I am poor, and weak, and blind; 
I am counting all but dross, I shall full salvation find. 

2. Long my heart has sigh'd for Thee, Long has evil reigned within; 
Jesus sweetly speaks to me, "I will cleanse you from all sin." 

3. Here I give my all to Thee, Friends and time and earthly store; 
Soul and body Thine to be, Wholly Thine forevermore. 

4. In Thy promises I trust, Now I feel the blood applied; 
I am prostrate in the dust, I with Christ am crucified. 

5. Jesus comes! He fills my soul; Perfected in Him I am; 
I am ev'ry whit made whole; Glory, glory to the Lamb! 

REFRAIN.
I am trusting, Lord, in Thee, Blessed Lamb of Calvary! 
Humbly at Thy cross I bow, 
Save me, Jesus, save me now. 
(Last) Jesus saves me, saves me now.
