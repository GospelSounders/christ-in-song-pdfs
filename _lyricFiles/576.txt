##TOILING ON
##“Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest...” (Hebrews 4:11).
. To the work! to the work! we are servants of 
God, Let us follow the path that our Master has trod; 
With the word of His counsel our strength to renew, 
Let us do with our might what our hands find to do. 
2. To the work! to the work! let the hungry be fed; To the Fountain of 
Life let the weary be led; 
In the cross and its banner, our glory shall be, 
While we herald the tidings, 
"Salvation is free!" 
3. To the work! to the work! there is labor for all, for the kingdom of darkness and error shall fall; 
And the name of Jehovah exalted shall be 
In the loud swelling chorus, 
"Salvation is free!" 
4. To the work! to the work! pressing on to the end, For the harvest will come, and the reapers descend; 
And the home of the ransom'd our dwelling will be, 
And our chorus forever, 
"Salvation is free!" 
Toiling on, toiling on, 
Toiling on, toiling on, 
Let us hope,   let us watch,   
And Toil ingon,  toil ingon,  Toil-ing on,  toil ingon,   and trust,    and pray,  labor till the Master comes.
