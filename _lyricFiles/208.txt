##SWEET PEACE, THE GIFT OF GOD’S LOVE
##“...Let the peace of God rule in your hearts...” (Colossians 3:15).
. There comes to my heart one sweet strain, (sweet strain,) 
A glad and a joyous refrain, (refrain,) 
I sing it again and again,  Sweet peace, the gift of 
God's love.  
2. Thro' Christ on the cross peace was made, (was made,) 
My debt by His death was all paid, (all paid,) 
No other foundation is laid,  For peace, the gift of 
God's love.  
3. When Jesus as Lord 
I had crowned, (had crowned,) 
My heart with this peace did abound (abound,) 
In Him the rich blessing 
I found,  Sweet peace, the gift of 
God's love.  
4. In Jesus for peace 
I abide, (abide,) 
And as I keep close to 
His side, (His side,) 
There's nothing but peace doth betide,  Sweet peace, the gift of 
God's love.    sweet peace, 
Wonderful gift from above  (above) 
Oh, wonderful, wonderful peace,  
Sweet peace the gift of God's love.
