##ANOTHER YEAR
##(Weber. 7s  6s.)
. Another year is dawning! 
Dear  Master, let it  be  
In working or in waiting, 
Another year with Thee. 
2. Another year of mercies, 
Of  faithfulness and  grace,  
Another year of gladness,â€” 
The shining of Thy face. 
3. Another year of service, 
Of  witness for Thy  love; 
Another year of training 
For holier work above.
