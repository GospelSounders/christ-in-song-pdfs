##THE HAVEN OF REST
##“...The Lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrows...” (Isaiah 14:3).
. My soul in sad exile was out on life's sea, 
So burdened with sin, and distressed, Come, Till 
I heard a sweet voice saying, "Make Me your choice;" 
And I entered the "Haven of 
Rest! "  
2. I yielded myself to 
His tender embrace, 
And faith taking hold of 
His Word,  My  fetters fell off, and 
I anchored my soul: 
The  "Haven of Rest" is my 
Lord.  
3. The song of my soul since the Lord made me whole, 
Has been the old story so blest,  Of  Jesus, who'll save whosoever will have 
A  home in the "Haven of 
Rest! "  
4. How precious the tho't that we all may recline, 
Like John the beloved and blest,  On  Jesus' strong arm, where no tempest can harm,— 
Secure in the "Haven of 
Rest! "  
5. O come to the Saviour! 
He patiently waits 
To save by His power divine;    anchor your soul in the "Haven of Rest," 
And  say, "My Beloved is mine."  I've anchored my soul in the 
"Haven of Rest," I  sail the wide seas  no more;  
The tempest may sweep o'er the wild, stormy deep, 
In Jesus I'm safe evermore.
