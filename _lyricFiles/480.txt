##LET THE LOWER LIGHTS BE BURNING
##â€œLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,
. Brightly beams our Father's mercy, 
From His lighthouse evermore,  
But to us He gives the keeping 
Of the lights along the shore. 
2. Dark the night of sin has settled, 
Loud the angry billows roar;  
Eager eyes are watching, longing, 
For the lights along the shore. 
3. Trim your feeble lamp, my brother: 
Some poor sailor tempesttost, 
Trying now to make the harbor, 
In the darkness may be lost. 
Let the lower lights be burning! 
Send a gleam across the wave!  
Some poor fainting, struggling seaman, 
You may rescue, you may save.
