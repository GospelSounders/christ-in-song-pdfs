##AN OPEN BIBLE FOR THE WORLD
##â€œAnd this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations;
. An open Bible for the world! May this our glorious motto be! 
On ev'ry breeze the truth unfurled Shall scatter blessings rich and free.  
2. Where'er it goes its golden light, Streaming as from unveiled sun, 
Shall dissipate the clouds of night, Undo the work that sin has done.  
3. It shows to men the 
Father's face, All radiant with forgiving love; 
And to the lost of 
Adam's race, Proclaims sweet mercy from above.  
4. It tells of Jesus and His death, Of life procured for dying men; 
And to each soul of humble faith, Gives sonship with the 
Lord again.  
5. It offers rest to weary hearts; It comforts those who sit in tears; 
To all who faint it strength imparts; And gilds with hope th'eternal years.  Blest word of 
God!  send forth thy light  
O'er ev'ry land and ev'ry sea,     
Till all who wander in the night   
Are led to God and heav'n by thee.
