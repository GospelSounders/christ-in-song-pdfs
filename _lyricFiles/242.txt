##’TIS SHINING STILL
##“...There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel” (Numbers 24:17).
. A beautiful star arose  one night, 
Divinely it shone with pur est light; 
Its wonderful rays the wise  men led 
To find the Saviour's low ly bed. 
2. They knew by the word of truth  divine, 
'Twas time that the guiding star  should shine; 
They follow'd its light which shone  afar,— 
'Twas Christ,  "the bright and morn ing star." 
3. We'll follow its light, like those of old, 
The "Light of the World," by seers  foretold; 
We'll follow His light till we shall come 
To per fect rest in heav'n,  my home.       shining still, 
That beautiful star, o'er plain  and hill; 
'Tis shining still, 'tis shining still, 
Salvation's star of God's  good will.
