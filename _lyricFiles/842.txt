##A STRANGER HERE
##(Oak. 6s  4s)
. I'm but a stranger here, 
Heav'n is my home; Earth is a desert drear, 
Heav'n is my home; Danger and sorrow  stand 
Round me on ev'ry  hand, 
Heav'n is my Fatherland, 
Heav'n is my home. 
2. What though the tempest rage, 
Heav'n is my home; Short is my pilgrimage, 
Heav'n is my home. Time's cold and wintry  blast 
Soon will be over past; 
I shall reach home at last; 
Heav'n is my home. 
3. There at my Saviour's side, 
Heav'n is my home; I shall be glorified, 
Heav'n is my home. There'll be the good and  blest, 
Those I love most and  best; 
There, too, I soon shall rest; 
Heav'n is my home.
