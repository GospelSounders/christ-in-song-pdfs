###“Who is this that cometh from Edom...travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save” (Isaiah 63:1).
1. O who is this that cometh From Edom's crimson plain, 
With wounded side, with garments dyed? O tell me now Thy name. 
"I that saw thy soul's distress, A ransom gave; 
I that speak in righteousness, Mighty to save." 

2. O why is Thine apparel With reeking gore all dyed, 
Like them that tread the winepress red? O why this bloody tide? 
"I the winepress trod alone, 'Neath dark'ning skies; 
Of the people there was none  Mighty to save." 

3. O bleeding Lamb, my Saviour! How could'st Thou bear this shame? 
"With mercy fraught, Mine own arm brought Salvation in My name; 
I the bloody fight have won, Conquer'd the grave, 
Now the year of joy has come, Mighty to save." 

CHORUS.
Mighty to save (&c), Mighty to save(&c),    
Mighty to save; Lord, I trust Thy wondrous love,  
Mighty to save.
