##WITH REVERENCE
##(Harveyâ€™s Chant. C. M.)
. With rev'rence let the saints appear, And bow before the 
Lord; His high commands with rev'rence hear, And tremble at 
His word, And tremble at 
His word. 
2. Sing, all ye ransomed of the 
Lord, Your great Deliv'rer sing; Ye pilgrims now for 
Zion bound, Be joyful in your King, Be joyful in your King. 
3. O Jesus, Lord of earth and heav'n, Our life and joy, to 
Thee Be honor, thanks, and blessing giv'n Thro' all eternity, Thro' all eternity.
