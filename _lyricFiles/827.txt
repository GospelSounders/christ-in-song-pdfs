##THY RIGHTEOUSNESS
##(Caddo. C. M.)
. O blest are they who oft  have  said, "I  thirst for righteousness; I hunger for the heav'nly Bread With  anguish  and distress." 
2. They of My fulness shall  be  fed, For  which they hungered sore; And by the Living 
Wa  ters led, Their  souls shall  thirst no more. 
3. Because I am the 
Truth,  the  Life, All  fulness dwells  in 
Me; They know no want, no sin,   no strife, Thro'  all eter nity. 
4. How blessed, then, to share  a  part With  those that hun ger here; To have the panting, thirs  ty heart, And  shed the  bitter tear.
