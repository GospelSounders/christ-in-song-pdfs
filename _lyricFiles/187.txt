##CONFORMED TO THEE
##(Holley. 7s.)
. When, my  Saviour, shall  
I  be Perfectly conformed to  
Thee? Poor and vile in my own  eyes, Only in 
Thy wisdom wise; 
2. Only  Thee content  to  know, Ignorant of  all  below; Only guided by  
Thy  light, Only mighty in Thy might? 
3. Fully  in my life  express All the  heights of  holiness; Sweetly let my spir it  prove All the depths of humble love.
