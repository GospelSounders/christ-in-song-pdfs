##ABIDING AND CONFIDING
##“Abide in me, and I in you” (John 15:4).
. I have learn'd the wondrous secret Of abiding in the Lord; 
I have found the strength and sweetness Of confiding in His word; I have tasted life's pure fountain, 
I am trusting in 
His blood, I have lost myself in Jesus, 
I am sinking into 
God. 
2. I am crucified with Jesus, And He lives and dwells in me, 
I have ceased from all my struggling, 'Tis no longer 
I, but He; All my will is yielded to Him, 
And His Spirit reigns within, And His precious blood each moment 
Keeps me cleans'd and free from sin. 
3. All my cares I cast upon Him, And He bears them all away; 
All my fears and griefs 
I tell Him, All my needs from day to day. All my strength 
I draw from Jesus, 
By His breath I live and move; E'en His very mind He gives me, 
And His faith, and life, and love. 
4. For my words I take 
His wisdom, For my works 
His Spirit's pow'r, 
For my ways His gracious Presence Guards and guides me ev'ry hour. Of my heart 
He is the Portion, 
Of my joy the ceaseless Spring; Saviour, 
Sanctifier, Keeper, 
Glorious Lord and coming 
King. I'm abid ing in the Lord, 
And confid ing in His word, 
And I'm hiding, safely hiding, 
In the I'm abid ing inthe Lord,  
I'm abid ing in the
Lord, And confid ing inHis word,  
And confid ing in Hisword, And I'm hid-ing, safely hiding, 
I am hid ing, safely hiding  bosom of His love.
