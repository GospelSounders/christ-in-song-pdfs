##WATCHMAN, TELL ME
##(Dawning. 8s  7s. D.)
. Watchman, tell me, does the morning 
Of fair Zion's glory dawn? 
Have the signs that mark His coming Yet upon thy pathway shone? Pilgrim, yes! arise, look round thee; 
Light is breaking in the skies;  
Gird thy bridal robes around thee, Morning dawns, arise! arise! 
2. Watchman, see, the light is beaming 
Brighter still upon thy way; 
Signs thro' all the earth are gleaming, Omens of thy coming day When the 
Jubal trumpet, sounding, 
Shall awake from land and sea  
All the saints of 
God now sleeping, Clad in immortality. 
3. Watchman, hail the light ascending 
Of the grand Sabbatic year; 
All with voices loud proclaiming That the kingdom now is near: Pilgrim, yes, I see just yonder, 
Canaan's glorious heights arise;  
Salem, too, appears in grandeur, Tow'ring 'neath its sunlit skies. 
4. Watchman, in that golden city, 
Seated on His jasper throne, 
Zion's King, arrayed in beauty, Reigns in peace from zone to zone; There on sunlit hills and mountains, 
Golden beams serenely glow;  
Purling streams and crystal fountains, On whose banks sweet flow'rets blow. 
5. Watchman, see, the land is nearing, 
With its vernal fruits and flow'rs; 
On, just yonder,— 
O how cheering! Bloom forever 
Eden's bow'rs. Hark, the choral strains are ringing, 
Wafted on the balmy air;  
See the millions, hear them singing, Soon the pilgrims will be there.
