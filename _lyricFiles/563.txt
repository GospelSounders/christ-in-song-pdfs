##JUST FOR TO-DAY
##“...The morrow shall take thought for the things of itself” (Matthew 6:34).
. Lord, for tomorrow and its needs, 
I do not pray; Keep me from ev'ry stain of sin 
Just for today; Let me no wrong or idle word Unthinking say; 
Set Thou a seal upon my lips, Just for today. Amen. 
2. I would both diligently work 
And duly pray; I would be kind in word and deed 
Just for today; O make me strong to do 
Thy will, Swift to obey, 
Willing to sacrifice myself, Just for today. Amen. 
3. And if today this life of mine 
Should ebb away, O may 
Thy promises divine, 
Still be my stay. So for tomorrow and its needs I do not pray; 
O keep me, guide me, hold me, 
Lord, Just for today. Amen.
