##WHEN THOU SHALT COME
##(Meribah. C. P. M.)
. When Thou, my righteous 
Judge, shall come, To call 
Thy ransom'd people home, 
Shall I among them stand? 
Shall such a worthless worm as I, Who sometimes am afraid to die, 
Be found at Thy right hand? 
2. I love to meet among them now, Before 
Thy gracious throne to bow, 
Though weakest of them all; 
Nor can I bear the piercing thought, To have my worthless name left out, 
When Thou for them shalt call. 
3. Let me among Thy saints be found, Whene'er th' Archangel's trump shall sound, 
To see Thy smiling face; 
Then joyfully Thy praise 
I'll sing, While heaven's resounding mansions ring 
With shouts of endless grace.
