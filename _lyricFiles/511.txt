##STRIKE FOR VICTORY
##“...Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ” (I Corinthians 15:57).
. Strike! O strike for vict'ry, 
Soldiers of the Lord,  
Hoping in His mercy, 
Trusting in His word;  
Lift the gospel banner 
High above the world;  
Let its folds of beauty 
Ever be unfurled.  
2. What tho' raging lions 
Meet us on the way!  
Zionward we're marching, 
Tow'rd the gates of day;  
Ever pressing on ward, 
Onward to the light,  
Till we reach the Jordan, 
With our home in sight.  
3. Strike! O strike for vict'ry, 
Heroes of the cross,  
Sacrificing pleasure, 
Glorying in loss;  
Bind the helmet strong er, 
Tighter grasp the sword;  
Conquering and to conquer, 
Battle for the Lord.  
4. Hand to hand united, 
Heart to heart as one,  
Let us still keep marching 
Till our journey's done,  
Till we see the an gels 
Come in glory down,  
With the shining garments 
And the victor's crown.  
Strike! strike for vict'ry, 
Heroes bold;  Strike! till the vict'ry 
You behold;  Faith is the vict'ry; 
Ne'er give o'er;  Rest then in glory 
Ever more.
