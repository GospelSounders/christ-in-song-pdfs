##SAVED TO SERVE
##“With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men” (Ephesians 6:7).
. Saved to serve in any station, 
Saved to make His goodness known; 
Saved to sing His great salvation, 
Saved to live for Him alone. 
2. Saved to show by loving kindness 
That His love is full and free; 
Saved to lead from error's blindness 
With a tender sympathy. 
3. Saved to lift my lowest brothers, 
As the Highest lifted me; 
Crucified with Him, that others 
May have immortality. 
Saved to serve; no reserve; 
Saved to wear His yoke alone: 
Work and praise, all my days, 
Here and round His glorious throne.
