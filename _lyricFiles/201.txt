##MY SINS ARE ALL TAKEN AWAY
##“None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him...” (Ezekiel 33:16).
. He will mention them no more forever, 
My sins are all taken away; 
For His royal promise changes never, My sins are all taken away. 
2. Since I came by faith to 
Calv'ry's mountain, 
My sins are all taken away; 
Thro' the cleansing pow'r of that blest 
Fountain, My sins are all taken away. 
3. At the bottom of the sea they're lying, 
My sins are all taken away; 
Now the pow'rs of sin and self denying, My sins are all taken away. 
4. Once the "carnal mind" was all my pleasure, 
My sins are all taken away; 
Now the word of God is my chief treasure, My sins are all taken away. 
5. Doubt can never stay where 
Faith is singing, 
"My sins are all taken away;" 
"Praise the Lord" within my heart is ringing, My sins are all taken away. 
They are all taken away, 
They are all taken away; 
He will mention them no more forever; 
Praise the Lord! sing it all day. They are all taken way, 
They are all taken away; 
I am resting in the great 
PeaceGiver, My sins are all taken away.
