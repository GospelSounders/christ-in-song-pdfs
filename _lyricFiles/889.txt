##HEAVEN AT LAST
##â€œ...Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man,
. Angel voices sweetly singing, 
Echoes thro' the blue dome ringing, 
News of wondrous gladness bringing; 
2. On the jasper threshold standing, 
Like a pilgrim safely land ing, 
See the strange, bright scene expanding; 
3. Softest voices, silver pealing, 
Freshest fragrance, spiritheal ing, 
Happy hymns around us stealing; 
4. Not a teardrop ever falleth, 
Not a pleasure ever pall eth, 
Song to song forever calleth; 
5. Christ, Himself, the living splendor, 
Christ the sunlight, mild and ten der; 
Praises to the 
Lamb we render; Ah, 'tis heav'n at last! 
Heav'n at last, heav'n at last; 
O, the joyful story of heav'n at  last!  
Heav'n at last, heav'n at last; 
Endless, boundless glory, 
In heav'n at last.
