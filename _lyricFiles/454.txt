##COME, LET US SING
##(Russia. L. M.)
. Come, let  us sing the song  of songs,— The an gels first  began  the strain,— The homage which to 
Christ  belongs:  "Worthy   the 
Lamb, for He  was slain! " 
2. Slain to  redeem us by  
His blood, To cleanse  from ev'ry sin ful stain, And make us kings and priests to  God: "Worthy   the 
Lamb, for He  was slain! " 
3. Long as we live, and when  we die, And while  in heav'n  with 
Him  we reign, This song our song of songs  shall  be: "Worthy   the 
Lamb, for He  was slain! "
